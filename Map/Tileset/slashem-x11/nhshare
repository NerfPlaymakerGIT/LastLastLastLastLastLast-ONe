	Abbathor is the sole evil dwarven god, the great master of the
	greed and avarice that plagues so many of that otherwise noble
	race. He is a hunched, twisted creature, warped by his own
	greeds, jealousies, and desires. Like many other deities, his
	name is often invoked by followers of other gods to keep him away
	from one's treasure.
	For it had been long apparent to Count Landulf that nothing
	could be done with his seventh son Thomas, except to make him
	an Abbot or something of that kind.  Born in 1226, he had from
	childhood a mysterious objection to becoming a predatory eagle,
	or even to taking an ordinary interest in falconry or tilting
	or any other gentlemanly pursuits.  He was a large and heavy and
	quiet boy, and phenomenally silent, scarcely opening his mouth
	except to say suddenly to his schoolmaster in an explosive
	manner, "What is God?"  The answer is not recorded but it is

	Aerdrie  Faenya is the elven goddess of air and weather. As a rain-

	perceived as a somewhat distant  goddess, and the fact that she  is
	also revered by some aarakocra slightly diminishes the  strength of
	elven  devotion to  her (as does  her definite  neutral tendency in
	alignment). The goddess  herself takes  delight in  the freedom  of
	the skies, the music  of wind instruments,  and (sometimes)  fairly
	severe and  violent thunderstorms. She is  friendly to all  avians,

	Bartels heard the sound twice more before the origin of the cries 
	moved off into the night. Bartels soon remembered a local legend 
	of the ahool or athol, a type of huge bat reputed to live in 
	the area.

	Locals described the bat as the size of a small child, with 
	an 11-12 foot wingspan. The athol was supposedly covered in 
	grayish fur and had a face similar to that of a monkey or a man. 
	At times, it was seen sitting on the forest floor, with its wings 
	folded beside it; it was also reputed to have feet which pointed
	backwards. During the day (like all bats, it was nocturnal), the 
	athol's refuge was supposedly a cave somewhere near a waterfall, 
	although at night it would fly over the river's surface in
	search of fish.

	Bugbears are relatives of goblins, although they tend to be
	larger and more hairy.  They are aggressive carnivores and
	sometimes kill just for the treasure their victims may be
	carrying.

	Bugbears are giant, hairy  cousins of goblins who frequent the same
	areas  as  their smaller  relatives.  Bugbears are  large and  very
	muscular, standing 7' tall.  Their hides range from light yellow to
	yellow brown  and their  thick coarse  hair varies  in colour  from
	brown  to  brick  red.  Though  vaguely   humanoid  in  appearance,
	bugbears seem to contain the  blood of some large  carnivore. Their
	eyes recall  those of  some savage  bestial animal, being  greenish
	white with  red pupils, while their  ears are  wedge shaped, rising
	from the  top of  their heads. A  bugbear's mouth  is full of  long
	sharp fangs.
	Bugbears have two main goals  in life: survival and  treasure. They
	are  superb  carnivores,  winnowing  out  the   weak  and  careless
	adventurer, monster, and animal. Goblins  are always on  their toes
	when  bugbears are present, for  the weak or  stupid quickly end up
	in the stewpot.

	Only once a year, on his birthday, did Charlie Bucket ever
	get to taste a bit of chocolate.  The whole family saved up
	their money for that special occasion, and when the great
	day arrived, Charlie was always presented with one small
	chocolate bar to eat all by himself.  And each time he
	received it, on those marvelous birthday mornings, he would
	place it carefully in a small wooden box that he owned, and
	treasure it as though it were a bar of solid gold; and for
	the next few days, he would allow himself only to look at it,
	but never to touch it.  Then at last, when he could stand it
	no longer, he would peel back a tiny bit of the paper
	wrapping at one corner to expose a tiny bit of chocolate, and
	then he would take a tiny nibble - just enough to allow the
	lovely sweet taste to spread out slowly over his tongue.  The
	next day, he would take another tiny nibble, and so on, and
	so on.  And in this way, Charlie would make his ten-cent bar
	of birthday chocolate last him for more than a month.

	the cat is killed.  If the event does not take place, the cat lives
	on.  In Schroedinger's original version, the quantum event was the
	decay of a radioactive atom.  ...  To the outside observer, the cat
	is indeed in a linear combination of being alive and dead, and only
	when the container is finally opened would the cat's state vector
	collapse into one or the other.  On the other hand, to a (suitably

	would have collapsed much earlier, and the outside observer's

	under the low overhang of the cave.  Once outside, he

	Among his kind, Moon-Watcher was almost a giant.  He was
	nearly five feet high, and though badly undernourished
	weighed over a hundred pounds.  His hairy, muscular body

	Of all the monsters put together by the Greek imagination
	the Centaurs (Kentauroi) constituted a class in themselves.
	Despite a strong streak of sensuality, in their make-up,
	their normal behaviour was moral, and they took a kindly
	thought of man's welfare.  The attempted outrage of Nessos on
	Deianeira, and that of the whole tribe of Centaurs on the
	Lapith women, are more than offset by the hospitality of
	Pholos and by the wisdom of Cheiron, physician, prophet,
	lyrist, and the instructor of Achilles.  Further, the
	Centaurs were peculiar in that their nature, which united the
	body of a horse with the trunk and head of a man, involved
	an unthinkable duplication of vital organs and important
	members.  So grotesque a combination seems almost un-Greek.
	These strange creatures were said to live in the caves and
	clefts of the mountains, myths associating them especially
	with the hills of Thessaly and the range of Erymanthos.

	Dantes rapidly cleared away the earth around the chest.  Soon
	the center lock appeared, then the handles at each end, all
	delicately wrought in the manner of that period when art made
	precious even the basest of metals.  He took the chest by the
	two handles and tried to lift it, but it was impossible.  He
	tried to open it; it was locked.  He inserted the sharp end
	of his pickaxe between the chest and the lid and pushed down
	on the handle.  The lid creaked, then flew open.
	Dantes was seized with a sort of giddy fever.  He cocked his
	gun and placed it beside him.  The he closed his eyes like a
	child, opened them and stood dumbfounded.
	The chest was divided into three compartments.  In the first
	were shining gold coins.  In the second, unpolished gold

	Once in a great while, when the positions of the stars are

	along will come a snake, to coil around the egg, or a toad,
	to squat upon the egg, keeping it warm and helping it to
	hatch.  When it hatches, out comes a creature called basilisk,
	or cockatrice, the most deadly of all creatures.  A single
	glance from its yellow, piercing toad's eyes will kill both
	man and beast.  Its power of destruction is said to be so
	great that sometimes simply to hear its hiss can prove fatal.

	There is, however, one creature which can withstand the

	Dispater is an arch-devil who rules the city of Dis.  He is
	a powerful mage.
	The djinn are genies from the elemental plane of Air.  There,
	among their kind, they have their own societies.  They are
	sometimes encountered on earth and may even be summoned here
	to perform some service for powerful wizards.  The wizards
	often leave them about for later service, safely tucked away
	in a flask or lamp.  Once in a while, such a tool is found by
	a lucky rogue, and some djinn are known to be so grateful
	when released that they might grant their rescuer a wish.
	A domestic animal, the _tame dog_ (_Canis familiaris_), of
	which numerous breeds exist.  The male is called a dog,
	while the female is called a bitch.  Because of its known
	loyalty to man and gentleness with children, it is the
	world's most popular domestic animal.  It can easily be
	trained to perform various tasks.
	This evil creature (_canis tenebrous_)  lurks in the darker, more
	sinister corners of the world. Its bite is known for its chilling
	effect upon humanoid flesh, and it is not a tameable animal.
	[ The New Bestiary, Wizard Endlebrook ]
	This hazy canine  (_canis precipitous_) is  thought to  have a good
	heart hiding somewhere within its green, silky hide. Unfortunately,
	the  beast is  usually ravenous,  as its diet  of mist is  not very
	filling, at least compared to human flesh.

	Many travelers have seen the drums of the great apes, and
	some have heard the sounds of their beating and the noise of
	the wild, weird revelry of these first lords of the jungle,

	being who ever joined in the fierce, mad, intoxicating revel
	of the Dum-Dum.

	Through me you pass into the city of woe:
	Through me you pass into eternal pain:
	Through me among the people lost for aye.
	Justice the founder of my fabric mov'd:
	To rear me was the task of power divine,
	Supremest wisdom, and primeval love.
	Before me things create were none, save things
	Eternal, and eternal I endure.

	"Then we can only give thanks that this is Antarctica, where
	there is not one, single, solitary, living thing for it to
	imitate, except these animals in camp."

	"Us," Blair giggled. "It can imitate us. Dogs can't make four
	hundred miles to the sea; there's no food. There aren't any
	skua gulls to imitate at this season. There aren't any
	penguins this far inland. There's nothing that can reach the
	sea from this point - except us. We've got brains. We can do

	In the West the dragon was the natural enemy of man.  Although
	preferring to live in bleak and desolate regions, whenever it
	was seen among men it left in its wake a trail of destruction
	and disease.  Yet any attempt to slay this beast was a perilous
	undertaking.  For the dragon's assailant had to contend
	not only with clouds of sulphurous fumes pouring from its fire
	breathing nostrils, but also with the thrashings of its tail,
	the most deadly part of its serpent-like body.

	"One whom the dragons will speak with," he said, "that is a
	dragonlord, or at least that is the center of the matter.  It's
	not a trick of mastering the dragons, as most people think.
	Dragons have no masters.  The question is always the same, with
	a dragon:  will he talk to you or will he eat you?  If you can
	count upon his doing the former, and not doing the latter, why
	then you're a dragonlord."

	faceted gem set against a mountainous silhouette.
	Dwarfs have faces like men (ugly men, with wrinkled, leathery
	skins), but are generally either flat-footed, duck-footed, or
	have feet pointing backwards.  They are of the earth, earthy,
	living in the darkest of caverns and venturing forth only
	with the cloaks by which they can make themselves invisible,
	and others disguised as toads.  Miners often come across them,
	and sometimes establish reasonably close relations with them.
	... The miners of Cornwall were always delighted to hear a
	bucca busily mining away, for all dwarfs have an infallible
	nose for precious metals.
	Among other things, dwarfs are rightly valued for their skill
	as blacksmiths and jewellers: they made Odin his famous spear
	Gungnir, and Thor his hammer; for Freya they designed a
	magnificent necklace, and for Frey a golden boar.  And in their
	spare time they are excellent bakers.  Ironically, despite
	their odd feet, they are particularly fond of dancing.  They
	can also see into the future, and consequently are excellent
	meteorologists.  They can be free with presents to people
	they like, and a dwarvish gift is likely to turn to gold in
	the hand.  But on the whole they are a snappish lot.

	In after days, when because of the triumph of Morgoth Elves and
	Men became estranged, as he most wished, those of the Elven-race
	that lived still in Middle-earth waned and faded, and Men usurped
	the sunlight.  Then the Quendi wandered in the lonely places of the
	great lands and the isles, and took to the moonlight and the
	starlight, and to the woods and the caves, becoming as shadows
	and memories, save those who ever and anon set sail into the West
	and vanished from Middle-earth.  But in the dawn of years Elves
	and Men were allies and held themselves akin, and there were some
	among Men that learned the wisdom of the Eldar, and became great
	and valiant among the captains of the Noldor.  And in the glory
	and beauty of the Elves, and in their fate, full share had the
	offspring of elf and mortal, Earendil, and Elwing, and Elrond
	their child.

	The behaviour of eels in fresh water extends the air of
	mystery surrounding them.  They move freely into muddy, silty
	bottoms of lakes, lying buried in the daylight hours in summer.
	[...]  Eels are voracious carnivores, feeding mainly at
	night and consuming a wide variety of fishes and invertebrate
	creatures.  Contrary to earlier thinking, eels seek living
	rather than dead creatures and are not habitual eaters of

	Elementals are manifestations of the basic nature of the

	for a fifth type, the spirit elemental, but none have ever
	been encountered, at least on this plane of existence.
	The Elves sat round the fire upon the grass or upon the sawn
	rings of old trunks.  Some went to and fro bearing cups and
	pouring drinks; others brought food on heaped plates and
	dishes.
	"This is poor fare," they said to the hobbits; "for we are
	lodging in the greenwood far from our halls.  If ever you are
	our guests at home, we will treat you better."
	"It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party," said Frodo.
	Pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink, for
	his mind was filled with the light upon the elf-faces, and the
	sound of voices so various and so beautiful that he felt in a

	Sam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to
	himself, what he felt or thought that night, though it remained
	in his memory as one of the chief events of his life.  The

	the singing that went to my heart, if you know what I mean."

	The Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Company the 
	clothes they had brought.  For each they had provided a hood 
	and cloak, made according to his size, of the light but warm 
	silken stuff that the Galadrim wove.  It was hard to say of 
	what colour they were: grey with the hue of twilight under

	At first only its tip was visible, but then it rose, straight,
	proud, all that was noble and great and wondrous.  The tip of
	the blade pointed toward the moon, as if it would cleave it
	in two.  The blade itself gleamed like a beacon in the night.
	There was no light source for the sword to be reflecting
	from, for the moon had darted behind a cloud in fear.  The
	sword was glowing from the intensity of its strength and
	power and knowledge that it was justice incarnate, and that
	after a slumber of uncounted years its time had again come.
	After the blade broke the surface, the hilt was visible, and
	holding the sword was a single strong, yet feminine hand,
	wearing several rings that bore jewels sparkling with the
	blue-green color of the ocean.

	There was a time when Rincewind had quite liked the iconoscope.
	He believed, against all experience, that the world was
	fundamentally understandable, and that if he could only equip
	himself with the right mental toolbox he could take the back off
	and see how it worked.  He was, of course, dead wrong.  The
	iconoscope didn't take pictures by letting light fall onto
	specially treated paper, as he had surmised, but by the far
	simpler method of imprisoning a small demon with a good eye for
	colour and a speedy hand with a paintbrush.  He had been very
	upset to find that out.

	This is a powerful amulet of ESP.  In addition to its standard
	powers, it regenerates the energy of anyone who carries

	protects from magic missiles.  Finally, when invoked it has
	the power to instantly open a portal to any other area of the

	no doubt as a precaution during the Carlist trouble in Spain
	-- painted or enameled over to look like nothing more than a

	A swirling cloud of bright, burning motes, the fire vampire
	descends upon its victim and easily burns them to death once
	they are in its deadly embrace.
	Floating eyes, not surprisingly, are large, floating eyeballs
	which drift about the dungeon.  Though not dangerous in and
	of themselves, their power to paralyse those who gaze at
	their large eye in combat is widely feared.  Many are the
	tales of those who struck a floating eye, were paralysed by
	its mystic powers, and then nibbled to death by some other
	creature that lurked around nearby.
	With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected
	the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark
	of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.  It was
	already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against
	the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the
	glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow
	eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive
	motion agitated its limbs.

	How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how
	delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I
	had endeavoured to form?  His limbs were in proportion, and I
	had selected his features as beautiful.  Beautiful!--Great God! 
	His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and
	arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and
	flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances
	only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that
	seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in
	which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight
	black lips.

	One hot summer's day a Fox was strolling through an orchard till he
	came to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which had been
	trained over a lofty branch. "Just the thing to quench my thirst,"
	quoth he. Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and a jump, and
	just missed the bunch. Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, he
	jumped up, but with no greater success. Again and again he tried

	away with his nose in the air, saying: "I am sure they are sour."

	Later on, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat

	"I was so sure you thoroughly hated her," he said, "that I gave
	her to your friend. Isn't her younger sister more attractive? Take
	her instead."
	Samson said to them, "This time I have a right to get even with
	the Philistines; I will really harm them." So he went out and
	caught three hundred foxes and tied them tail to tail in pairs. He
	then fastened a torch to every pair of tails, lit the torches and
	let the foxes loose in the standing grain of the Philistines.

	Fungi, division of simple plants that lack chlorophyll, true
	stems, roots, and leaves.  Unlike algae, fungi cannot
	photosynthesize, and live as parasites or saprophytes.  The
	division comprises the slime molds and true fungi.  True
	fungi are multicellular (with the exception of yeasts); the
	body of most true fungi consists of slender cottony
	filaments, or hyphae.  All fungi are capable of asexual
	reproduction by cell division, budding, fragmentation, or
	spores.  Those that reproduce sexually alternate a sexual
	generation (gametophyte) with a spore-producing one.  The
	four classes of true fungi are the algaelike fungi (e.g.,
	black bread mold and downy mildew), sac fungi (e.g., yeasts,
	powdery mildews, truffles, and blue and green molds such as
	Penicillium), basidium fungi (e.g., mushrooms and puffballs)
	and imperfect fungi (e.g., species that cause athlete's foot
	and ringworm).  Fungi help decompose organic matter (important
	in soil renewal); are valuable as a source of antibiotics,
	vitamins, and various chemicals; and for their role in
	fermentation, e.g., in bread and alcoholic beverage
	production.

	And so it came to pass that while Man ruled on Earth, the
	gargoyles waited, lurking, hidden from the light.  Reborn
	every 600 years in Man's reckoning of time, the gargoyles
	joined battle against Man to gain dominion over the Earth.

	In each coming, the gargoyles were nearly destroyed by Men
	who flourished in greater numbers.  Now it has been so many
	hundreds of years that it seems the ancient statues and
	paintings of gargoyles are just products of Man's
	imagination.  In this year, with Man's thoughts turned toward
	the many ills he has brought among himself, Man has forgotten
	his most ancient adversary, the gargoyles.

	1 November - All day long we have travelled, and at a good
	speed.  The horses seem to know that they are being kindly
	treated, for they go willingly their full stage at best
	speed.  We have now had so many changes and find the same
	thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the
	journey will be an easy one.  Dr. Van Helsing is laconic, he
	tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays
	them well to make the exchange of horses.  We get hot soup,
	or coffee, or tea, and off we go.  It is a lovely country.
	Full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are
	brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nice
	qualities.  They are very, very superstitious.  In the first
	house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the
	scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and put out two
	fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye.  I believe they
	went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into
	our food, and I can't abide garlic.  Ever since then I have
	taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have
	escaped their suspicions.
		[ Dracula, by Bram Stoker ]
	Geryon is an arch-devil sometimes called the Wild Beast,
	attacking with his claws and poison sting.  His ranking in
	Hell is rumored to be quite low.
	And now the souls of the dead who had gone below came swarming
	up from Erebus -- fresh brides, unmarried youths, old men
	with life's long suffering behind them, tender young girls
	still nursing this first anguish in their hearts, and a great
	throng of warriors killed in battle, their spear-wounds gaping
	yet and all their armour stained with blood.  From this
	multitude of souls, as they fluttered to and fro by the
	trench, there came a moaning that was horrible to hear.
	Panic drained the blood from my cheeks.
		 [ The Odyssey, (chapter Lambda), by Homer ]
	The forces of the gloom know each other, and are strangely
	balanced by each other.  Teeth and claws fear what they cannot
	grasp.  Blood-drinking bestiality, voracious appetites, hunger
	in search of prey, the armed instincts of nails and jaws which
	have for source and aim the belly, glare and smell out
	uneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a
	shroud, erect in its vague and shuddering robe, and which seem
	to them to live with a dead and terrible life.  These
	brutalities, which are only matter, entertain a confused fear
	of having to deal with the immense obscurity condensed into an
	unknown being.  A black figure barring the way stops the wild
	beast short.  That which emerges from the cemetery intimidates
	and disconcerts that which emerges from the cave; the
	ferocious fear the sinister; wolves recoil when they encounter
	a ghoul.
		[ Les Miserables, by Victor Hugo ]
	Giants have always walked the earth, though they are rare in
	these times.  They range in size from little over nine feet
	to a towering twenty feet or more.  The larger ones use huge
	boulders as weapons, hurling them over large distances.  All
	types of giants share a love for men - roasted, boiled, or
	fried.  Their table manners are legendary.
	[Gila monsters] are stout-bodied lizards with short legs and a short,
	fat tail. They're covered with bright irregular markings, usually
	pink, yellow or white, against black or brown scales. They are shy,
	retiring creatures unless they're provoked. Then they can be
	dangerous because they secrete a neurotoxin -- a poison that
	destroys nerve tissue -- from their salivary glands. In humans,
	their bite can result in severe pain and even death.
	    [Expedition Guide -- American Museum of Natural History]
	The people of Komodo call this animal "ora." Elsewhere it is known
	as the Komodo Island monitor or more popularly, the Komodo dragon.
	Oras can reach 10 feet in length and weigh 300 pounds or more --
	particularly after a meal. They are the top predators in their
	habitat, feeding on wild boar, deer, water buffalo, dogs, goats,
	rats, snakes, birds, other oras, and -- once in a great while --
	humans. They hunt by ambush, hiding in the scrub brush along trails
	and in the tall grass of the savannas. Despite their lumbering
	appearance, oras can move with alarming speed when they want to,
	lunging from their hiding places and sprinting toward their
	startled victims. They can't sustain a long chase, but often all
	they need to subdue their prey is one bite. Oras carry poisonous
	bacteria in their mouths so even if they don't immediately catch
	their prey, the attack is often fatal. Using their long forked
	tongues (oras and other monitor lizards are closely related to
	snakes), they track the scent of their prey as the wounded animal
	slowly weakens from the infected bite -- a process that can take
	several days. When the victim can no longer flee, the ora moves
	in for the kill. Oras are voracious eaters. They devour every bit
	of their prey -- bones, fur, hooves -- ripping off huge chunks with
	their razor-sharp serrated teeth and swallowing the pieces whole.

	The glaive is a knife-bladed spear. It has the thrusting 
	function of the spear, and the secondary cutting function of 
	the convex blade of the knife. The weapon was rapidly enlarged 
	in the blade in order to give it a greater cutting function as

	Far beneath the surface of the earth dwell the Svirfneblin, or Deep
	Gnomes. Small parties of these demihumans roam the Underdark's mazes
	of small passageways searching for gemstones. They are said to dwell
	in great cities consisting of a closely connected series of tunnels,
	buildings, and caverns in which up to a thousand of these diminutive
	creatures live. They keep the location of these hidden cities secret
	in order to protect them from their deadly foes, the kuo-toa, Drow,
	and mind flayers.
	Svirfneblin are slightly smaller than rock gnomes, but their thin,
	wiry, gnarled frames are just as strong. Their skin is rock-colored,
	usually medium brown to brownish gray, and their eyes are gray. Male
	svirfneblin are completely bald; female deep gnomes have stringy gray
	hair. The average svirfneblin life span is 250 years.

	...  And then a gnome came by, carrying a bundle, an old
	fellow three times as large as an imp and wearing clothes of
	a sort, especially a hat.  And he was clearly just as frightened
	as the imps though he could not go so fast.  Ramon Alonzo
	saw that there must be some great trouble that was vexing
	magical things; and, since gnomes speak the language of men, and
	will answer if spoken to gently, he raised his hat, and asked
	of the gnome his name.  The gnome did not stop his hasty
	shuffle a moment as he answered 'Alaraba' and grabbed the rim
	of his hat but forgot to doff it.
	'What is the trouble, Alaraba?'  said Ramon Alonzo.
	'White magic.  Run!'  said the gnome ..

 	"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know," Harry told Ron as
 	they crossed the lawn.
 	"Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes," said Ron,
 	bent double with his head in a peony bush, "like fat little
 	Santa Clauses with fishing rods..."
 	There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered,
 	and Ron straightened up.  "This is a gnome," he said grimly.
 	"Geroff me! Gerroff me!" squealed the gnome.
 	It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus.  It was small and
 	leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like
 	a potato.  Ron held it at arm's length as it kicked out at him
 	with its horny little feet; he grasped it around the ankles
 	and turned it upside down.

	Goddesses and Gods operate in ones, threesomes, or whole

	to have made the world, and this is indeed a likely claim in
	the case of threesomes or pantheons:  Fantasyland does have
	the air of having been made by a committee.  But all Goddesses
	and Gods, whether they say they made the world or not, have
	very detailed short-term plans for it which they are determined
	to carry out.  Consequently they tend to push people into the
	required actions by the use of coincidence or Prophecy, or just
	by narrowing down your available choices of what to do next:
	if a deity is pushing you, things will go miserably badly until

	"The original story harks back, so they say, to the sixteenth
	century.  Using long-lost formulas from the Kabbala, a rabbi is
	said to have made an artificial man -- the so-called Golem -- to
	help ring the bells in the Synagogue and for all kinds of other
	menial work.
	"But he hadn't made a full man, and it was animated by some sort
	of vegetable half-life.  What life it had, too, so the story
	runs, was only derived from the magic charm placed behind its
	teeth each day, that drew down to itself what was known as the
	`free sidereal strength of the universe.'
	"One evening, before evening prayers, the rabbi forgot to take
	the charm out of the Golem's mouth, and it fell into a frenzy.
	It raged through the dark streets, smashing everything in its
	path, until the rabbi caught up with it, removed the charm, and
	destroyed it.  Then the Golem collapsed, lifeless.  All that was
	left of it was a small clay image, which you can still see in

	This form of a pole axe is seen as a convex-headed broad axe 
	in early examples, but the head is set at a convenient angle, 
	considering the point where the blade is most likely to impact 
	upon an enemy. This alone makes it quite distinct from an 
	ordinary long-hafted axe. The whole weapon reaches 8 feet in length, 
	and is nearly always topped with a long spear point and backed by 
	a spike, which was often angled or hooked slightly downward. 
	The spear point is, of course, designed to keep opponents at bay 
	and deliver a thrusting attack (this proves quite useless when 
	opposing mounted knights armed with lances). The opposing spike was 
	for penetration of heavy plate armor, with a secondary function as a 
	hook for dismounting opponents.

	The shopkeeper of the lighting shop in the town level of the
	gnomish mines is a tribute to Izchak Miller, a founding member
	of the NetHack development team and a personal friend of a large
	number of us.  Izchak contributed greatly to the game, coding a
	large amount of the shopkeep logic (hence the nature of the tribute)
	as well as a good part of the alignment system, the prayer code and
	the rewrite of "hell" in the 3.1 release.  Izchak was a professor
	of Philosophy, who taught at many respected institutions, including
	MIT and Stanford, and who also worked, for a period of time, at
	Xerox PARC.  Izchak was the first "librarian" of the NetHack project,
	and was a founding member of the DevTeam, joining in 1986 while he
	was working at the University of Pennsylvania (hence our former
	mailing list address).  Until the 3.1.3 release, Izchak carefully
	kept all of the code synchronized and arbitrated disputes between
	members of the development teams.  Izchak Miller passed away at the
	age of 58, in the early morning hours of April 1, 1994 from
	complications due to cancer.  We then dedicated NetHack 3.2 in his
	memory.

	In Asiatic folktale, jackal provides for the lion; he scares
	up game, which the lion kills and eats, and receives what is
	left as reward.  In stories from northern India he is
	sometimes termed "minister to the king," i.e. to the lion.
	From the legend that he does not kill his own food has arisen
	the legend of his cowardice.  Jackal's heart must never be
	eaten, for instance, in the belief of peoples indigenous to
	the regions where the jackal abounds. ... In Hausa Negro

	The kabuto is the helmet worn by the samurai.  It was
	characterized by a prominent beaked front which jutted out over
	the brow to protect the wearer's face; a feature that gives
	rise to their modern Japanese name of 'shokaku tsuki kabuto'
	(battering-ram helmet).  Their main constructional element
	was an oval plate, the shokaku bo, slightly domed for the
	head with a narrow prolongation in front that curved forwards
	and downwards where it developed a pronounced central
	fold.  Two horizontal strips encircling the head were riveted
	to this frontal strip:  the lower one, the koshimaki (hip
	wrap), formed the lower edge of the helmet bowl; the other,
	the do maki (body wrap), was set at about the level of the
	temples.  Filling the gaps between these strips and the shokaku
	bo were small plates, sometimes triangular but more commonly
	rectangular in shape.  Because the front projected so
	far from the head, the triangular gap beneath was filled by
	a small plate, the shoshaku tei ita, whose rear edge bent
	downwards into a flange that rested against the forehead.

	Ector took both his sons to the church before which the

	off the steel.  "Now it is your turn", Ector said facing
	Arthur.
	The young man lifted the sword and thrust with both arms; the
	blade whizzed through the air with a flash and drilled the
	metal as if it were mere butter.  Ector and Kay dropped to
	their knees before Arthur.
	"Why, father and brother, do you bow before me?", Arthur asked
	with wonder in his voice.
	"Because now I know for sure that you are the king, not only

	The race of kobolds are reputed to be an artificial creation
	of a master wizard (demi-god?).  They are about 3' tall with
	a vaguely dog-like face.  They bear a violent dislike of the
	Elven race, and will go out of their way to cause trouble
	for Elves at any time.
	The Kops are a brilliant concept.  To take a gaggle of inept
	policemen and display them over and over again in a series of
	riotously funny physical punishments plays equally well to the
	peanut gallery and the expensive box seats.  People hate cops.
	Even people who have never had anything to do with cops hate
	them.  Of course, we count on them to keep order and to protect
	us when we need protecting, and we love them on television shows
	in which they have nerves of steel and hearts of gold, but in
	the abstract, as a nation, collectively we hate them.  They are
	too much like high school principals.  We're very happy to see
	their pants fall down, and they look good to us with pie on
	their faces.  The Keystone Kops turn up--and they get punished
	for it, as they crash into each other, fall down, and suffer
	indignity after indignity.  Here is pure movie satisfaction.

	The Kops are very skillfully presented.  The comic originality
	and timing in one of their chase scenes requires imagination
	to think up, talent to execute, understanding of the medium,
	and, of course, raw courage to perform.  The Kops are madmen
	presented as incompetents, and they're madmen rushing around
	in modern machines.  What's more, the machines they were operating
	in their routines were newly invented and not yet experienced
	by the average moviegoer.  (In the early days of automobiles,
	it was reported that there were only two cars registered in all
	of Kansas City, and they ran into each other.  There is both

	Blind Io took up the dice-box, which was a skull whose various
	orifices had been stoppered with rubies, and with several of

	was the nature of the Lady's eyes:  they were bright green,
	lacking iris or pupil, and they glowed from within.

	The room was silent as she scrabbled in her box of pieces and,
	from the very bottom, produced a couple that she set down on
	the board with two decisive clicks.  The rest of the players,
	as one God, craned forward to peer at them.

	and scarlet eyes opened and glowed like hellish coals, and two
	ophidian fangs glittered in an ape-like mouth.  A squat, furless,
	shapeless head on a neck of disproportionate extent leaned
	unspeakably down and whispered in the mummy's ear. Then, with

	Not for payment, that is," he added after a pause.

	"So?" he said.  "I'll kill him.  Then you rob him.  Is he that

	"Yes."
	Zlorf stared at Twoflower, who grinned at him.  He shrugged.

	Yakwawi, the Mastodon, was placed on the world to be useful

	Medusa, one of the three Gorgons or Graeae, is the only one
	of her sisters to have assumed mortal form and inhabited the
	dungeon world.

	When Perseus was grown up Polydectes sent him to attempt the
	conquest of Medusa, a terrible monster who had laid waste the
	country.  She was once a beautiful maiden whose hair was her
	chief glory, but as she dared to vie in beauty with Minerva,
	the goddess deprived her of her charms and changed her
	beautiful ringlets into hissing serpents.  She became a cruel
	monster of so frightful an aspect that no living thing could
	behold her without being turned into stone.  All around the
	cavern where she dwelt might be seen the stony figures of men
	and animals which had chanced to catch a glimpse of her and
	had been petrified with the sight.  Perseus, favoured by
	Minerva and Mercury, the former of whom lent him her shield
	and the latter his winged shoes, approached Medusa while she
	slept and taking care not to look directly at her, but guided
	by her image reflected in the bright shield which he bore, he
	cut off her head and gave it to Minerva, who fixed it in the
	middle of her Aegis.

	Originating in India (Mitra), Mithra is a god of light who
	was translated into the attendant of the god Ahura Mazda in
	the light religion of Persia; from this he was adopted as
	the Roman deity Mithras.  He is not generally regarded as a
	sky god but a personification of the fertilizing power of
	warm, light air.  According to the _Avesta_, he possesses
	10,000 eyes and ears and rides in a chariot drawn by white
	horses.  Mithra, according to Zarathustra, is concerned with
	the endless battle between light and dark forces:  he
	represents truth.  He is responsible for the keeping of oaths
	and contracts.  He is attributed with the creation of both
	plants and animals.  His chief adversary is Ahriman, the
	power of darkness.

	Forged by the dwarves Eitri and Brokk, in response to Loki's
	challenge, Mjollnir is an indestructible war hammer.  It has
	two magical properties:  when thrown it always returned to
	Thor's hand; and it could be made to shrink in size until it
	could fit inside Thor's shirt.  Its only flaw is that it has
	a short handle.  The other gods judged Mjollnir the winner of
	the contest because, of all the treasures created, it alone had
	the power to protect them from the giants.  As the legends
	surrounding Mjollnir grew, it began to take on the quality of
	"vigja", or consecration.  Thor used it to consecrate births,
	weddings, and even to raise his goats from the dead.  In the
	Norse mythologies Mjollnir is considered to represent Thor's
	governance over the entire cycle of life - fertility, birth,

	One day, an army general invited the Buddhist monk I-Hsiu
	(literally, "One Rest") to his military head office for a
	dinner.  I-Hsiu was not accustomed to wearing luxurious
	clothings and so he just put on an old ordinary casual
	robe to go to the military base.  To him, "form is void".

	As he approached the base, two soldiers appeared before him
	and shouted, "Where does this beggar came from?  Identify
	yourself!  You do not have permission to be around here!"

	"My name is I-Hsiu Dharma Master.  I am invited by your
	general for a supper."

	The two soldiers examined the monk closely and said, "You
	liar.  How come my general invites such a shabby monk to
	dinner?  He invites the very solemn venerable I-Hsiu to our
	base for a great ceremony today, not you.  Now, get out!"

	I-Hsiu was unable to convince the soldiers that he was
	indeed the invited guest, so he returned to the temple
	and changed to a very formal solemn ceremonial robe for
	the dinner.  And as he returned to the military base, the
	soldiers observed that he was such a great Buddhist monk,
	let him in with honour.

	At the dinner, I-Hsiu sat in front of the table full of
	food but, instead of putting the food into his month, he
	picked up the food with his chopsticks and put it into
	his sleeves.  The general was curious, and whispered to
	him, "This is very embarrassing.  Do you want to take
	some food back to the temple?  I will order the cook to
	prepare some take out orders for you."  "No" replied the
	monk.  "When I came here, I was not allowed into the
	base by your soldiers until I wear this ceremonial robe.
	You do not invite me for a dinner.  You invite my robe.
	Therefore, my robe is eating the food, not me."

	Othin.  He is the prime god of the Norsemen:  god of war and
	victory, wisdom and prophecy, poetry, the dead, air and wind,
	hospitality, and magic.
	As the god of war and victory, Odin is ruler of the Valkyries,

	the hall of dead heroes where he held his court.
	These chosen ones will defend the realm of the gods against

	As a god of hospitality, he enjoys visiting the earth in
	disguise to see how people were behaving and to see how they
	would treat him, not knowing who he was.
	Odin is usually represented as a one-eyed wise old man with a
	long white beard and a wide-brimmed hat (he gave one of his
	eyes to Mimir, the guardian of the well of wisdom in Hel, in

	Orcs, bipeds with a humanoid appearance, are related to the

	is only moderately intelligent, has broad, muscled shoulders,
	a short neck, a sloping forehead and a thick, dark fur.
	Their lower eye-teeth are pointing forward, like a boar's.
	Female orcs are more lightly built and bare-chested.  Not
	needing any clothing, they do like to dress in variegated
	apparels.  Suspicious by nature, orcs live in tribes or
	hordes.  They tend to live underground as well as above
	ground (but they dislike sunlight).  Orcs can use all weapons,
	tools and armours that are used by men.  Since they don't have
	the talent to fashion these themselves, they are constantly
	hunting for them.  There is nothing a horde of orcs cannot
	use.

	Orion was the son of Neptune. He was a handsome giant and a
	mighty hunter. His father gave him the power of wading
	through the depths of the sea, or, as others say, of
	walking on its surface.

	He dwelt as a hunter with Diana (Artemis), with whom he
	was a favourite, and it is even said she was about to marry
	him. Her brother was highly displeased and often chid her,
	but to no purpose. One day, observing Orion wading through
	the sea with his head just above the water, Apollo pointed
	it out to his sister and maintained that she could not hit
	that black thing on the sea. The archer-goddess discharged
	a shaft with fatal aim. The waves rolled the dead body of
	Orion to the land, and bewailing her fatal error with many
	tears, Diana placed him among the stars, where he appears
	as a giant, with a girdle, sword, lion's skin, and
	club. Sirius, his dog, follows him, and the Pleiads fly

	Conan cried out sharply and recoiled, thrusting his companion
	back.  Before them rose the great shimmering white form of Satha,
	an ageless hate in its eyes.  Conan tensed himself for one mad
	berserker onslaught -- to thrust the glowing faggot into that
	fiendish countenance and throw his life into the ripping sword-
	stroke.  But the snake was not looking at him.  It was glaring
	over his shoulder at the man called Pelias, who stood with his
	arms folded, smiling.  And in the great, cold, yellow eyes
	slowly the hate died out in a glitter of pure fear -- the only
	time Conan ever saw such an expression in a reptile's eyes.
	With a swirling rush like the sweep of a strong wind, the great
	snake was gone.
	"What did he see to frighten him?" asked Conan, eyeing his

	A variant of the pike, the ranseur has a thin, double-edged

	set well below the large central blade, forming a crown-shape. 
	The spearing function of the weapon is apparent, and the 
	deflection includes the trapping of opponent weapons in the space 
	below the main blade, where a twist of the shaft would apply 
	pressure from it or the secondary projections to either break the 
	caught weapon or disarm its wielder. Additionally, the side

	And I was gazing on the surges prone,
	With many a scalding tear and many a groan,
	When at my feet emerg'd an old man's hand,
	Grasping this scroll, and this same slender wand.
	I knelt with pain--reached out my hand--had grasp'd
	Those treasures--touch'd the knuckles--they unclasp'd--
	I caught a finger: but the downward weight
	O'erpowered me--it sank. Then 'gan abate
	The storm, and through chill aguish gloom outburst
	The comfortable sun. I was athirst
	To search the book, and in the warming air
	Parted its dripping leaves with eager care.
	Strange matters did it treat of, and drew on
	My soul page after page, till well-nigh won
	Into forgetfulness; when, stupefied,
	I read these words, and read again, and tried
	My eyes against the heavens, and read again.

	Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field

	hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
	And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of

	in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of

	said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:  for God doth
	know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be
	opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.  And
	when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it
	was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one

	A spell is a consciously directed act of magic which may take

	in all his life before such a hand at quarterstaff.  At last
	Robin gave the stranger a blow upon the ribs that made his
	jacket smoke like a damp straw thatch in the sun.  So shrewd
	was the stroke that the stranger came within a hair's breadth
	of falling off the bridge; but he regained himself right
	quickly, and, by a dexterous blow, gave Robin a crack on the
	crown that caused the blood to flow.  Then Robin grew mad
	with anger, and smote with all his might at the other; but
	the stranger warded the blow, and once again thwacked Robin,
	and this time so fairly that he fell heels over head into the

	the way the lion was standing that it couldn't have been
	looking at him at all.  ("But supposing it turns its head?"

	namely a little dwarf who stood with his back to it about
	four feet away.  "Aha!" thought Edmund.  "When it springs at

	remembered what the others had said about the White Witch
	turning people into stone.  Perhaps this was only a stone

	agonized and terrible, for all that they remained 
	remote - yet the ship followed them, as if drawn by
	them; they grew louder-pain and despair were there, but

	Elric had heard such sounds echoing from his cousin Yyrkoon's
	sardonically named 'Pleasure Chambers' in the days before he 
	had fled the responsibilities of ruling all that remained of 
	the old Melnibonean Empire.  These were the voices of men 
	whose very souls were under siege; men to whom death meant 
	not mere extinction, but a continuation of existence, forever 
	in thrall to some cruel and supernatural master.  He had heard 
	men cry so when his salvation and his nemesis, his great black
	battle-blade Stormbringer, drank their souls.
		[ The Lands Beyond the World, by Michael Moorcock ]

	Without thinking, he drew Stormbringer from its sheath.
	The Black Sword began to howl and the familiar black radiance
	spilled from it.  The runes carved into its blade pulsed a vivid
	scarlet which slowly turned to a deep purple and then to black
	once more.
	The creatures were wading through the water on their
	stiltlike legs and paused when they saw the sword, glancing at
	one another.  And they were not the only ones unnerved by the
	sight, for Duke Avan and his men paled too.
	'Gods!' yelled Duke Avan.  'I know not which I prefer
	the look of - those who attack us or that which defends us!'

	Softly the albino spoke: 'I've noticed that fact, but I'm not 
	disturbed by it,' and he had drawn the black blade even as he
	finished speaking, for they had come at him with a rush.
	The Pan Tangian was the first to die, sliced through the
	side, his vertebrae sheared, and Stormbringer, having taken its
	first soul, began to sing.
	A Chalalite died next, leaping with stabbing javelin
	poised, on the point of the runesword, and Stormbringer murmured
	with pleasure.

	round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze
	of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mind-bogglingly
	stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't
	see you - daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can
	wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of
	course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean
	enough.

		  by Douglas Adams ]
	Towers (_brooding_, _dark_) stand alone in Waste Areas and
	almost always belong to Wizards.  All are several stories high,
	round, doorless, virtually windowless, and composed of smooth
	blocks of masonry that make them very hard to climb. [...]
	You will have to go to a Tower and then break into it at some
	point towards the end of your Tour.

	I knew my Erik too well to feel at all comfortable on jumping
	into his house.  I knew what he had made of a certain palace at
	Mazenderan.  From being the most honest building conceivable, he
	soon turned it into a house of the very devil, where you could
	not utter a word but it was overheard or repeated by an echo.
	With his trap-doors the monster was responsible for endless
	tragedies of all kinds.
		[ The Phantom of the Opera, by Gaston Leroux ]
	The trapper is a creature which has evolved a chameleon-like
	ability to blend into the dungeon surroundings.  It captures
	its prey by remaining very still and blending into the
	surrounding dungeon features, until an unsuspecting creature
	passes by.  It wraps itself around its prey and digests it.
	I think that I shall never see
	A poem lovely as a tree.
	A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
	Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;
	A tree that looks at God all day,
	And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
	A tree that may in Summer wear
	A nest of robins in her hair;
	Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
	Who intimately lives with rain.
	Poems are made by fools like me,
	But only God can make a tree.
		[ Trees - Joyce Kilmer ]
	If you start from scratch, cooking tripe is a long-drawn-out
	affair.  Fresh whole tripe calls for a minimum of 12 hours of
	cooking, some time-honored recipes demanding as much as 24.
	To prepare fresh tripe, trim if necessary.  Wash it thoroughly,
	soaking overnight, and blanch, for 1/2 hour in salted water.
	Wash well again, drain and cut for cooking.  When cooked, the
	texture of tripe should be like that of soft gristle.  More
	often, alas, because the heat has not been kept low enough,
	it has the consistency of wet shoe leather.
		[ Joy of Cooking, by I Rombauer and M Becker ]
	The troll shambled closer.  He was perhaps eight feet tall,
	perhaps more.  His forward stoop, with arms dangling past
	thick claw-footed legs to the ground, made it hard to tell.
	The hairless green skin moved upon his body.  His head was a
	gash of a mouth, a yard-long nose, and two eyes which drank
	the feeble torchlight and never gave back a gleam.
	[...]
	Like a huge green spider, the troll's severed hand ran on its
	fingers.  Across the mounded floor, up onto a log with one
	taloned forefinger to hook it over the bark, down again it
	scrambled, until it found the cut wrist.  And there it grew
	fast.  The troll's smashed head seethed and knit together.
	He clambered back on his feet and grinned at them.  The
	waning faggot cast red light over his fangs.
		[ Three Hearts and Three Lions, by Poul Anderson ]
	This most ancient of swords has been passed down through the
	leadership of the Samurai legions for hundreds of years.  It
	is said to grant luck to its wielder, but its main power is
	terrible to behold.  It has the capability to cut in half any
	creature it is wielded against, instantly killing them.
	The tsurugi, also known as the long samurai sword, is an
	extremely sharp, two-handed blade favored by the samurai.
	It is made of hardened steel, and is manufactured using a
	special process, causing it to never rust.  The tsurugi is
	rumored to be so sharp that it can occasionally cut
	opponents in half!
	"Rincewind!"
	Twoflower sprang off the bed.  The wizard jumped back,
	wrenching his features into a smile.
	"My dear chap, right on time!  We'll just have lunch, and
	then I'm sure you've got a wonderful programme lined up for
	this afternoon!"
	"Er --"
	"That's great!"
	Rincewind took a deep breath.  "Look," he said desperately,
	"let's eat somewhere else.  There's been a bit of a fight
	down below."
	"A tavern brawl?  Why didn't you wake me up?"
	"Well, you see, I - _what_?"
	"I thought I made myself clear this morning, Rincewind.  I
	want to see genuine Morporkian life - the slave market, the
	Whore Pits, the Temple of Small Gods, the Beggar's Guild...
	and a genuine tavern brawl."  A faint note of suspicion
	entered Twoflower's voice.  "You _do_ have them, don't you?
	You know, people swinging on chandeliers, swordfights over
	the table, the sort of thing Hrun the Barbarian and the
	Weasel are always getting involved in.  You know --
	_excitement_."
		[ The Colour of Magic, by Terry Pratchett ]
	Yet remains that one of the Aesir who is called Tyr:
	he is most daring, and best in stoutness of heart, and he
	has much authority over victory in battle; it is good for
	men of valor to invoke him.  It is a proverb, that he is
	Tyr-valiant, who surpasses other men and does not waver.
	He is wise, so that it is also said, that he that is wisest
	is Tyr-prudent.  This is one token of his daring:  when the
	Aesir enticed Fenris-Wolf to take upon him the fetter Gleipnir,
	the wolf did not believe them, that they would loose him,
	until they laid Tyr's hand into his mouth as a pledge.  But
	when the Aesir would not loose him, then he bit off the hand
	at the place now called 'the wolf's joint;' and Tyr is one-
	handed, and is not called a reconciler of men.
		[ The Prose Edda, by Snorri Sturluson ]
	Umber hulks are powerful subterranean predators whose
	iron-like claws allow them to burrow through solid stone in
	search of prey.  They are tremendously strong; muscles bulge
	beneath their thick, scaly hides and their powerful arms and
	legs all end in great claws.
	Men have always sought the elusive unicorn, for the single
	twisted horn which projected from its forehead was thought to
	be a powerful talisman.  It was said that the unicorn had
	simply to dip the tip of its horn in a muddy pool for the water
	to become pure.  Men also believed that to drink from this horn
	was a protection against all sickness, and that if the horn was
	ground to a powder it would act as an antidote to all poisons.
	Less than 200 years ago in France, the horn of a unicorn was
	used in a ceremony to test the royal food for poison.

	Although only the size of a small horse, the unicorn is a very
	fierce beast, capable of killing an elephant with a single
	thrust from its horn.  Its fleetness of foot also makes this
	solitary creature difficult to capture.  However, it can be
	tamed and captured by a maiden.  Made gentle by the sight of a
	virgin, the unicorn can be lured to lay its head in her lap, and
	in this docile mood, the maiden may secure it with a golden rope.
	[ Mythical Beasts, by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library) ]

	Martin took a small sip of beer.  "Almost ready," he said.
	"You hold your beer awfully well."
	Tlingel laughed.  "A unicorn's horn is a detoxicant.  Its
	possession is a universal remedy.  I wait until I reach the
	warm glow stage, then I use my horn to burn off any excess and
	keep me right there."
		[ Unicorn Variations, by Roger Zelazny ]
	"Aye, we must stick together," growled Ugluk. "I don't trust you 
	little swine. You've got no guts outside your own sties. But for 
	us you'd all have run away. We are the fighting Uruk-Hai! We slew 
	the great warrior. We took the prisoners. We are the servants of 
	Saruman the Wise, the White Hand: the hand that gives us 
	man's-flesh to eat. We came out of Isengard, and led you
	here, and we shall lead you back by the way we choose. I am 
	Ugluk. I have spoken."

	[ The Return of the King, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
	The Valkyries were the thirteen choosers of the slain, the
	beautiful warrior-maids of Odin who rode through the air and
	over the sea.  They watched the progress of the battle and
	selected the heroes who were to fall fighting.  After they
	were dead, the maidens rewarded the heroes by kissing them
	and then led their souls to Valhalla, where the warriors
	lived happily in an ideal existence, drinking and eating
	without restraint and fighting over again the battles in
	which they died and in which they had won their deathless
	fame.
		[ The Encyclopaedia of Myths and Legends of All
			Nations, by Herbert Robinson and Knox
			Wilson ]
	The Oxford English Dictionary is quite unequivocal:
	_vampire_ - "a preternatural being of a malignant nature (in
	the original and usual form of the belief, a reanimated
	corpse), supposed to seek nourishment, or do harm, by sucking
	the blood of sleeping persons. ..."
	Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, was the daughter of
	Jupiter and Dione.  Others say that Venus sprang from the
	foam of the sea.  The zephyr wafted her along the waves to
	the Isle of Cyprus, where she was received and attired by
	the Seasons, and then led to the assembly of the gods.  All
	were charmed with her beauty, and each one demanded her
	for his wife.  Jupiter gave her to Vulcan, in gratitude for
	the service he had rendered in forging thunderbolts.  So
	the most beautiful of the goddesses became the wife of the
	most ill-favoured of gods.
		[ Bulfinch's Mythology, by Thomas Bulfinch ]
	Vlad Dracula the Impaler was a 15th-Century monarch of the
	Birgau region of the Carpathian Mountains, in what is now
	Romania.  In Romanian history he is best known for two things.
	One was his skilled handling of the Ottoman Turks, which kept
	them from making further inroads into Christian Europe.  The
	other was the ruthless manner in which he ran his fiefdom.
	He dealt with perceived challengers to his rule by impaling
	them upright on wooden stakes.  Visiting dignitaries who
	failed to doff their hats had them nailed to their head.
	Swirling clouds of pure elemental energies, the vortices are
	thought to be related to the larger elementals.  Though the
	vortices do no damage when touched, they are noted for being
	able to envelop unwary travellers.  The hapless fool thus
	swallowed by a vortex will soon perish from exposure to the
	element the vortex is composed of.
	Place a hefty cleaver at the end of a long, stout shaft, and 
	the leverage which the pole gives the wielder will enable him 
	to cleave through armor. The voulge has no provision to keep 
	the enemy at a distance in its basic model, but with the top 
	front or back edge is ground down so as to provide a pointed, 
	dagger-like tip, the weapon assumes a more complete form.
	The vrock is one of the weaker forms of demon.  It resembles
	a cross between a human being and a vulture and does physical
	damage by biting and by using the claws on both its arms and
	feet.
	The samurai warrior traditionally wears two swords; the
	wakizashi is the shorter of the two.  See also katana.
	'Saruman!' he cried, and his voice grew in power and authority.
	'Behold, I am not Gandalf the Grey, whom you betrayed.  I am
	Gandalf the White, who has returned from death.  You have no
	colour now, and I cast you from the order and from the Council.'
	He raised his hand, and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice.
	'Saruman, your staff is broken.'  There was a crack, and the
	staff split asunder in Saruman's hand, and the head of it
	fell down at Gandalf's feet.  'Go!' said Gandalf.  With a cry
	Saruman fell back and crawled away.
		[ The Two Towers, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
	Suddenly Aragorn leapt to his feet.  "How the wind howls!"
	he cried.  "It is howling with wolf-voices.  The Wargs have
	come west of the Mountains!"
	"Need we wait until morning then?" said Gandalf.  "It is as I
	said.  The hunt is up!  Even if we live to see the dawn, who
	now will wish to journey south by night with the wild wolves
	on his trail?"
	"How far is Moria?" asked Boromir.
	"There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles
	as the crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,"
	answered Gandalf grimly.
	"Then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if we can,"
	said Boromir.  "The wolf that one hears is worse than the orc
	that one fears."
	"True!" said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath.  "But
	where the warg howls, there also the orc prowls."
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
	They had come together at the ford of the Trident while the
	battle crashed around them, Robert with his warhammer and his
	great antlered helm, the Targaryen prince armored all in
	black.  On his breastplate was the three-headed dragon of his
	House, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the
	sunlight.  The waters of the Trident ran red around the
	hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed, again
	and again, until at last a crushing blow from Robert's hammer
	stove in the dragon and the chest behind it.  When Ned had
	finally come on the scene, Rhaegar lay dead in the stream,
	while men of both armies scrambled in the swirling waters for
	rubies knocked free of his armor.
		[ A Game of Thrones, by George R.R. Martin ]
	Day after day, day after day,
	We stuck, nor breath nor motion;
	As idle as a painted ship
	Upon a painted ocean.

	Water, water, everywhere,
	And all the boards did shrink;
	Water, water, everywhere
	Nor any drop to drink.

	Oh what a tangled web we weave,

		[ Marmion, by Sir Walter Scott ]
	When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall
	nothing except a sense of dread.  Then suddenly he knew that
	he was imprisoned, caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow.  A
	Barrow-wight had taken him, and he was probably already under
	the dreadful spells of the Barrow-wights about which whispered
	tales spoke.  He dared not move, but lay as he found himself:
	flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his
	breast.
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
	Ebenezum walked before me along the closest thing we could
	find to a path in these overgrown woods.  Every few paces he
	would pause, so that I, burdened with a pack stuffed with
	arcane and heavy paraphernalia, could catch up with his
	wizardly strides.  He, as usual, carried nothing, preferring,
	as he often said, to keep his hands free for quick conjuring
	and his mind free for the thoughts of a mage.
		[ A Dealing with Demons, by Craig Shaw Gardner ]
	No one knows how old this mighty wizard is, or from whence he
	came.  It is known that, having lived a span far greater than
	any normal man's, he grew weary of lesser mortals; and so,
	spurning all human company, he forsook the dwellings of men
	and went to live in the depths of the Earth.  He took with
	him a dreadful artifact, the Book of the Dead, which is said
	to hold great power indeed.  Many have sought to find the
	wizard and his treasure, but none have found him and lived to
	tell the tale.  Woe be to the incautious adventurer who
	disturbs this mighty sorcerer!
	The ancestors of the modern day domestic dog, wolves are
	powerful muscular animals with bushy tails.  Intelligent,
	social animals, wolves live in family groups or packs made
	up of multiple family units.  These packs cooperate in hunting
	down prey.
	The Usenet Oracle requires an answer to this question!

	> How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could
	> chuck wood?

	"Oh, heck!  I'll handle *this* one!"  The Oracle spun the terminal
	back toward himself, unlocked the ZOT-guard lock, and slid the
	glass guard away from the ZOT key.  "Ummmm....could you turn around
	for a minute?  ZOTs are too graphic for the uninitiated.  Even *I*
	get a little squeamish sometimes..."  The neophyte turned around,
	and heard the Oracle slam his finger on a computer key, followed
	by a loud ZZZZOTTTTT and the smell of ozone.
		[ Excerpted from Internet Oracularity 576.6 ]
	[The crysknife] is manufactured in two forms from teeth taken
	from dead sandworms.  The two forms are "fixed" and "unfixed".
	An unfixed knife requires proximity to a human body's
	electrical field to prevent disintegration.  Fixed knives
	are treated for storage.  All are about 20 centimeters long.
		[ Dune, by Frank Herbert ]
	Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim
	and dark, the shapes became terribly clear.  He was able to
	see beneath their black wrappings.  There were five tall
	figures:  two standing on the lip of the dell, three advancing.
	In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; under
	their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs
	were helms of silver; in their haggard hands were swords of
	steel.  Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they
	rushed towards him.  Desperate, he drew his own sword, and
	it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a
	firebrand.  Two of the figures halted.  The third was taller
	than the others:  his hair was long and gleaming and on his
	helm was a crown.  In one hand he held a long sword, and in
	the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held it
	glowed with a pale light.  He sprang forward and bore down
	on Frodo.
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
	The Wumpus, by the way, is not bothered by the hazards since
	he has sucker feet and is too big for a bat to lift.  If you
	try to shoot him and miss, there's also a chance that he'll
	up and move himself into another cave, though by nature the
	Wumpus is a sedentary creature.
		[ wump(6) -- "Hunt the Wumpus" ]
	They sent their friend the mosquito [xan] ahead of them to
	find out what lay ahead.  "Since you are the one who sucks
	the blood of men walking along paths," they told the mosquito,
	"go and sting the men of Xibalba."  The mosquito flew
	down the dark road to the Underworld.  Entering the house of
	the Lords of Death, he stung the first person that he saw...

	The mosquito stung this man as well, and when he yelled, the
	man next to him asked, "Gathered Blood, what's wrong?"  So
	he flew along the row stinging all the seated men until he
	knew the names of all twelve.
			[ Popul Vuh, as translated by Ralph Nelson ]
	A distant cousin of the earth elemental, the xorn has the
	ability to shift the cells of its body around in such a way
	that it becomes porous to inert material.  This gives it the
	ability to pass through any obstacle that might be between it
	and its next meal.
	The arrow of choice of the samurai, ya are made of very
	straight bamboo, and are tipped with hardened steel.
	Yeenoghu, the demon lord of gnolls, still exists although
	all his followers have been wiped off the face of the earth.
	He casts magic projectiles at those close to him, and a mere
	gaze into his piercing eyes may hopelessly confuse the
	battle-weary adventurer.
	The Abominable Snowman, or yeti, is one of the truly great
	unknown animals of the twentieth century.  It is a large hairy
	biped that lives in the Himalayan region of Asia ... The story
	of the Abominable Snowman is filled with mysteries great and
	small, and one of the most difficult of all is how it got that
	awful name.  The creature is neither particularly abominable,
	nor does it necessarily live in the snows.  _Yeti_ is a Tibetan
	word which may apply either to a real, but unknown animal of
	the Himalayas, or to a mountain spirit or demon -- no one is
	quite sure which.  And after nearly half a century in which
	Westerners have trampled around looking for the yeti, and
	asking all sorts of questions, the original native traditions
	concerning the creature have become even more muddled and
	confused.
		[ The Encyclopedia of Monsters, by Daniel Cohen ]
	Japanese leather archery gloves.  Gloves made for use while
	practicing had thumbs reinforced with horn.  Those worn into
	battle had thumbs reinforced with a double layer of leather.
	The samurai is highly trained with a special type of bow,
	the yumi.  Like the ya, the yumi is made of bamboo.  With
	the yumi-ya, the bow and arrow, the samurai is an extremely
	accurate and deadly warrior.
	The zombi... is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but
	taken from the grave and endowed by sorcery with a
	mechanical semblance of life, -- it is a dead body which is
	made to walk and act and move as if it were alive.

        Welcome to NetHack!                ( description of version 3.4 )

        NetHack is a Dungeons and Dragons like game where you (the adventurer)
descend into the depths of the dungeon in search of the Amulet of Yendor,
reputed to be hidden somewhere below the twentieth level.  You begin your
adventure with a pet that can help you in many ways, and can be trained
to do all sorts of things.  On the way you will find useful (or useless)
items, quite possibly with magic properties, and assorted monsters.  You can
attack a monster by trying to move onto the space a monster is on (but often
it is much wiser to leave it alone).

        Unlike most adventure games, which give you a verbal description of
your location, NetHack gives you a visual image of the dungeon level you are
on.

        NetHack uses the following symbols:

        - and |  The walls of a room, possibly also open doors or a grave.
        .        The floor of a room or a doorway.
        #        A corridor, or iron bars, or a tree, or possibly a kitchen
                 sink (if your dungeon has sinks), or a drawbridge.
        >        Stairs down: a way to the next level.
        <        Stairs up: a way to the previous level.
        @        You (usually), or another human.
        )        A weapon of some sort.
        [        A suit or piece of armor.
        %        Something edible (not necessarily healthy).
        /        A wand.
        =        A ring.
        ?        A scroll.
        !        A potion.
        (        Some other useful object (pick-axe, key, lamp...)
        $        A pile of gold.
        *        A gem or rock (possibly valuable, possibly worthless).
        +        A closed door, or a spell book containing a spell
                 you can learn.
        ^        A trap (once you detect it).
        "        An amulet, or a spider web.
        0        An iron ball.
        _        An altar, or an iron chain.
        {        A fountain.
        }        A pool of water or moat or a pool of lava.
        \        An opulent throne.
        `        A boulder or statue.
        A to Z, a to z, and several others:  Monsters.
        I        Invisible or unseen monster's last known location

                 You can find out what a symbol represents by typing
                 '/' and following the directions to move the cursor
                 to the symbol in question.  For instance, a 'd' may
                 turn out to be a dog.


y k u   7 8 9   Move commands:
 \|/     \|/            yuhjklbn: go one step in specified direction
h-.-l   4-.-6           YUHJKLBN: go in specified direction until you
 /|\     /|\                        hit a wall or run into something
b j n   1 2 3           g<dir>:   run in direction <dir> until something
      numberpad                     interesting is seen
                        G<dir>,   same, except a branching corridor isn't
 <  up                  ^<dir>:     considered interesting (the ^ in this
                                    case means the Control key, not a caret)
 >  down                m<dir>:   move without picking up objects
                        F<dir>:   fight even if you don't sense a monster
                If the number_pad option is set, the number keys move instead.
                Depending on the platform, Shift number (on the numberpad),
                Meta number, or Alt number will invoke the YUHJKLBN commands.
                Control <dir> may or may not work when number_pad is enabled,
                depending on the platform's capabilities.

Commands:
        NetHack knows the following commands:
        ?       Help menu.
        `       Main Menu.
        /       Tell what a symbol represents.  You may choose to specify
                a location or give a symbol argument.
        &       Tell what a command does.
        <       Go up a staircase (if you are standing on it).
        >       Go down a staircase (if you are standing on it).
        .       Rest, do nothing for one turn.
        _       Travel via a shortest-path algorithm to a point on the map 
        a       Apply (use) a tool (pick-axe, key, lamp...)
        A       Remove all armor.
        ^A      Redo the previous command

        ^B      Steal
        c       Close a door.
        C       Call (name) an individual monster.
        d       Drop something.  d7a:  drop seven items of object a.
        D       Drop multiple items.  This command is implemented in two
                different ways.  One way is:
                "D" displays a list of all of your items, from which you can
                pick and choose what to drop.  A "+" next to an item means
                that it will be dropped, a "-" means that it will not be
                dropped.  Toggle an item to be selected/deselected by typing
                the letter adjacent to its description.  Select all items
                with "+", deselect all items with "=".  The <SPACEBAR> moves
                you from one page of the listing to the next.
                The other way is:
                "D" will ask the question "What kinds of things do you want
                to drop? [!%= au]".  You should type zero or more object
                symbols possibly followed by 'a' and/or 'u'.
                Da - drop all objects, without asking for confirmation.
                Du - drop only unpaid objects (when in a shop).
                D%u - drop only unpaid food.
        ^D      Kick (for doors, usually).
        f       Fire ammunition from quiver.
        F       Followed by direction, fight a monster (even if you don't
                sense it).
        e       Eat food. Vampires cannot eat as such. However, they can
                gain nutrition by draining blood from fresh corpses using
                this command.
        E       Engrave a message on the floor.
                E- - write in the dust with your fingers.
        f       Fire ammunition from quiver.
        i       Display your inventory.
        I       Display selected parts of your inventory, as in
                I* - list all gems in inventory.
                Iu - list all unpaid items.
                Ix - list all used up items that are on your shopping bill.
                I$ - count your money.
	n#      repeat next command             
	N       name or classify an item
        o       Open a door.
        O       Review current options and possibly change them.
                A menu displaying the option settings will be displayed
                and most can be changed by simply selecting their entry.
                Options are usually set before the game with a NETHACKOPTIONS
                environment variable, or via a config file (defaults.nh,
                Slash'EM Defaults, nethack.cnf, .nethackrc, etc.), not with 
                the 'O' command.
        p       Pay your shopping bill/Shopkeeper services.
        P       Put on an accessory (ring, amulet, etc).
        ^P      Repeat last message (subsequent ^P's repeat earlier messages).
                The behavior can be varied via the msg_window option.
        q       Drink (quaff) something (potion, water, etc).
        Q       Select ammunition for quiver.
        r       Read a scroll or spell book.
        R       Remove an accessory (ring, amulet, etc).

        !       Escape to a shell, if supported in your version and OS.
        #       Introduces one of the "extended" commands.  To get a list of
                the commands you can use with "#" type "#?".  The extended
                commands you can use depends upon what options the game was
                compiled with, along with your class and what type of monster
                you most closely resemble at a given moment.  If your keyboard
                has a meta key (which, when pressed in combination with another
                key, modifies it by setting the 'meta' (8th, or 'high') bit),
                these extended commands can be invoked by meta-ing the first
                letter of the command.  An alt key may have a similar effect.

        If the "number_pad" option is on, some additional letter commands
        are available:

        h       displays the help menu, like '?'
        j       Jump to another location.
        k       Kick (for doors, usually).
        K       List vanquished monsters (whether by you or not).
        l       Loot a box on the floor.
        n       followed by number of times to repeat the next command
        N       Name an object or type of object.
        u       Untrap a trapped object or door.

        You can put a number before a command to repeat it that many times,
        as in "40." or "20s.".  If you have the number_pad option set, you
        must type 'n' to prefix the count, as in "n40." or "n20s".


        Some information is displayed on the bottom line or perhaps in a
        box, depending on the platform you are using.  You see your
        attributes, your alignment, what dungeon level you are on, how many
        hit points you have now (and will have when fully recovered), what
        your armor class is (the lower the better), your experience level,
        and the state of your stomach.  Optionally, you may or may not see
        other information such as spell points, how much gold you have, etc.

        Have Fun, and Happy Hacking!

SLASH'EM History file for release 0.0.7

Behold, mortal, the origins of SLASH'EM...

Jay Fenlason wrote the original Hack with help from Kenny Woodland,
Mike Thome, and Jon Payne.

Andries Brouwer did a major re-write, transforming Hack into a very different
game, and published (at least) three versions (1.0.1, 1.0.2, and 1.0.3) for
UNIX(tm) machines to the Usenet.

Don G. Kneller ported Hack 1.0.3 to Microsoft(tm) C and MS-DOS(tm), producing
PC HACK 1.01e, added support for DEC Rainbow graphics in version 1.03g, and
went on to produce at least four more versions (3.0, 3.2, 3.51, and 3.6).

R. Black ported PC HACK 3.51 to Lattice(tm) C and the Atari 520/1040ST,
producing ST Hack 1.03.

Mike Stephenson merged these various versions back together, incorporating
many of the added features, and produced NetHack version 1.4.  He then
coordinated a cast of thousands in enhancing and debugging NetHack 1.4 and
released NetHack versions 2.2 and 2.3.
 
Later, Mike coordinated a major rewrite of the game, heading a team which
included Ken Arromdee, Jean-Christophe Collet, Steve Creps, Eric Hendrickson,
Izchak Miller, Eric S. Raymond, John Rupley, Mike Threepoint, and Janet Walz,
to produce NetHack 3.0c.  The same group subsequently released ten patch-
level revisions and updates of 3.0.

NetHack 3.0 was ported to the Atari by Eric R. Smith, to OS/2 by Timo
Hakulinen, and to VMS by David Gentzel.  The three of them and Kevin Darcy
later joined the main development team to produce subsequent revisions of
3.0.

Olaf Seibert ported NetHack 2.3 and 3.0 to the Amiga.  Norm Meluch, Stephen
Spackman and Pierre Martineau designed overlay code for PC NetHack 3.0.
Johnny Lee ported NetHack 3.0 to the Macintosh.  Along with various other
Dungeoneers, they continued to enhance the PC, Macintosh, and Amiga ports
through the later revisions of 3.0.

A scant one month before the next major version  release  of Nethack,  two  
adventurous souls undertook their own modification to the sacred Nethack
formula. Tom Proudfoot and  Yuval  released Nethack++,   which  was rapidly
renamed Nethack--,  containeing new monsters,  items and other miscellaneous
modifications.
 
Headed by Mike Stephenson and coordinated by Izchak Miller and Janet Walz,
the development team which now included Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs,
Jean-Christophe Collet, Kevin Darcy, Matt Day, Timo Hakulinen, Steve Linhart,
Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Raymond, and Eric Smith undertook a radical
revision of 3.0.  They re-structured the game's design, and re-wrote major
parts of the code.  They added multiple dungeons, a new display, special
individual character quests, a new endgame and many other new features, and
produced NetHack 3.1.

Ken Lorber, Gregg Wonderly and Greg Olson, with help from Richard Addison,
Mike Passaretti, and Olaf Seibert, developed NetHack 3.1 for the Amiga.

Norm Meluch and Kevin Smolkowski, with help from Carl Schelin, Stephen
Spackman, Steve VanDevender, and Paul Winner, ported NetHack 3.1 to the PC.

Jon Watte and Hao-yang Wang, with help from Ross Brown, Mike Engber, David
Hairston, Michael Hamel, Jonathan Handler, Johnny Lee, Tim Lennan, Rob Menke,
and Andy Swanson developed NetHack 3.1 for the Macintosh, porting it for
MPW.  Building on their development, Barton House added a Think C port.  

Timo Hakulinen ported NetHack 3.1 to OS/2.  Eric Smith ported NetHack 3.1
to the Atari.  Pat Rankin, with help from Joshua Delahunty, is responsible
for the VMS version of NetHack 3.1.  Michael Allison ported NetHack 3.1 to
Windows NT.

Dean Luick, with help from David Cohrs, developed NetHack 3.1 for X11.
Warwick Allison added in the "tiled" version of the game and generated most
of the individual tiles for NetHack 3.2.

Time passed,  and Nethack-- was ported to 3.11 by Chris.

Stephen White then released his own  modification  known  as Nethack  Plus,
which  contained  new  character classes.  Unbeknownst to the world at large,
Tom Proudfoot  took  this  source and combined it with his Nethack--.
Stephen White went on to add weapon skills,  which were eventually integrated
into  the  next version of Nethack,  and other features.

In February 1996,  Tom Proudfoot released SLASH V1.  Including part of
Stephen White's Nethack Plus and his  own  Nethack--, leaving  unmentioned
his own slew of further modifications,  this is perhaps the best known of
the Nethack modifications.  Six versions of this,  ending with SLASH V6,
are known to exist.

The 3.2 development team, comprised of: Michael Allison; Ken Arromdee; David
Cohrs; Jessie Collet; Steve Creps; Kevin Darcy; Timo Hakulinen; Steve
Linhart; Dean Luick; Pat Rankin; Eric Smith; Mike Stephenson; Janet Walz; and
Paul Winner, released version 3.2 in April of 1996.

Version 3.2 marks the tenth anniversary of the formation of the development
team.  In a testament to their dedication to the game, all thirteen members
of the original development team remained on the team at the start of work
on the current release.  During the interval between the release of 3.1.3
and 3.2, one of the founding members of the development team, Dr. Izchak
Miller, passed away.  This release of the game is dedicated to him by the
development and porting teams.

Version 3.2 proved to be more stable than previous versions.  Many bugs
were fixed, abuses eliminated, and game features tuned for better game
play.

SLASH V6 was picked up by Enrico Horn managed to synchronize it  with the
3.2 source.  The new SLASH 4.1.2 was released as far back as November 1996
went through at least 4 editlevels (E5, E6, E7)  with  the  latest  version
being 4.1.2E8,  synchronized with Nethack 3.2.2 and the Blackmarket option
available,  released in June 1997.

Nathan La began the arduous task of drawing  tiles  for  the SLASH monsters.

Kentaro Shirakata ported SLASH 4.1.2E8 to Unix.

Lief Clennon ported SLASH 4.1.2E8 to OS/2.

Romain Dolbeau ported SLASH 4.1.2E8 to Macintosh.

Warren Cheung combined SLASH 4.1.2 and Wizard Patch to  create SLASH'EM 0.1
in November 1997.  Several revisions including new spells and other minor
additions have led to SLASH'EM  0.0.3. Steven Uy has generously made
additional modifications.

Dirk  Schoenberger has continued updating the SLASH/SLASH'EM monster tiles.
He has also ported SLASH'EM to Linux.

Lief Clennon ported SLASH'EM to OS/2 EMX.

Kevin Hugo ported SLASH'EM to Macintosh,  and has also contributed
additional changes and improvements.

Robin Johnson finished arduous task of drawing tiles for the SLASH'EM
monsters.  He has also contributed many more new tiles.

Kevin later joined the DevTeam and incorporated the best of these ideas
in NetHack 3.3.

JNetHack (the Japanese version of NetHack) has been around since at least
1994, developed by Issei Numata and others. The GTK interface was written
for this variant and released in 1999.

Mitsuhiro Itakura headed a team which began the process of redrawing the
NetHack tiles in 8-bit color at 32x32 pixels.

The final update to 3.2 was the bug fix release 3.2.3, which was released
simultaneously with 3.3.0 in December 1999 just in time for the Year 2000.

The 3.3 development team, consisting of Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee,
David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Steve Creps, Kevin Darcy, Timo Hakulinen,
Kevin Hugo, Steve Linhart, Ken Lorber, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Smith,
Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner, released 3.3.0 in
December 1999 and 3.3.1 in August of 2000.

Version 3.3 offered many firsts. It was the first version to separate race
and profession. The Elf class was removed in preference to an elf race,
and the races of dwarves, gnomes, and orcs made their first appearance in
the game alongside the familiar human race.  Monk and Ranger roles joined
Archeologists, Barbarians, Cavemen, Healers, Knights, Priests, Rogues,
Samurai, Tourists, Valkyries and of course, Wizards.  It was also the first
version to allow you to ride a steed, and was the first version to have a
publicly available web-site listing all the bugs that had been discovered.
Despite that constantly growing bug list, 3.3 proved stable enough to last
for more than a year and a half.

Warren Cheung combined SLASH'EM 0.0.5E7F1 and NetHack 3.3 to create
SLASH'EM 0.0.6 and maintained the DOS and Microsoft Windows ports.

J. Ali Harlow incorporated the GTK interface and Mitsuhiro Itakura's 32x32
tileset into SLASH'EM 0.0.6 and maintained the UNIX port of SLASH'EM 0.0.6.
Peter Makholm maintained the Debian package.

Paul Hurtley maintained the MAC port of SLASH'EM 0.0.6.

The 3.4 development team initially consisted of Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee,
David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Kevin Hugo, Ken Lorber, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin,
Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner, with Warwick Allison joining
just before the release of NetHack 3.4.0 in March 2002.

As with version 3.3, various people contributed to the game as a whole as
well as supporting ports on the different platforms that NetHack runs on:

Pat Rankin maintained 3.4 for VMS.

Michael Allison maintained NetHack 3.4 for the MS-DOS platform.
Paul Winner and Yitzhak Sapir provided encouragement.

Dean Luick, Mark Modrall, and Kevin Hugo maintained and enhanced the
Macintosh port of 3.4.

Michael Allison, David Cohrs, Alex Kompel, Dion Nicolaas, and Yitzhak Sapir
maintained and enhanced 3.4 for the Microsoft Windows platform. Alex Kompel
contributed a new graphical interface for the Windows port. Alex Kompel also
contributed a Windows CE port for 3.4.1.

Ron Van Iwaarden maintained 3.4 for OS/2.

Janne Salmijarvi and Teemu Suikki maintained and enhanced the
Amiga port of 3.4 after Janne Salmijarvi resurrected it for 3.3.1.

Christian `Marvin' Bressler maintained 3.4 for the Atari after he
resurrected it for 3.3.1.

Warren Cheung, Christian Cooper, J. Ali Harlow, Paul Hurtley, Pekka Rousu
and Darshan Shaligram combined SLASH'EM 0.0.6E5F2 and Nethack 3.4
to create SLASH'EM 0.0.7

sparkle        display sparkly effect for resisted magical        [TRUE]
               attacks (e.g. fire attack on fire-resistant monster)
standout       use standout mode for --More-- on messages         [FALSE]

There are further boolean options controlled by compilation flags.

Boolean option if INSURANCE was set at compile time:
checkpoint save game state after each level change, for possible  [TRUE]
           recovery after program crash

Boolean option if NEWS was set at compile time:
news       print any news from game administrator on startup      [TRUE]

Boolean option if MFLOPPY was set at compile time:
checkspace check free disk space before writing files to disk     [TRUE]

Boolean option if EXP_ON_BOTL was set at compile time:
showexp    display your accumulated experience points             [FALSE]

Boolean option if SCORE_ON_BOTL was set at compile time:
showscore  display your approximate accumulated score             [FALSE]

Boolean option if SHOW_DMG was set at compile time:
showdmg    display damage inflicted/received on message line      [FALSE]

Boolean options if SHOW_WEIGHT was set at compile time:
invweight  display weights of items in inventory in braces        [FALSE]
showweight display total weight in inventory on bottom line       [FALSE]

Boolean options if TEXTCOLOR was set at compile time:

               display effect.  on MSDOS without the termcap
               lib, whether or not to pause for visual effect.    

Boolean options if KEEP_SAVE was set at compile time:
keep_savefile  keep save file after restore                       [FALSE]

Boolean option if USE_TILES was set at compile time (MSDOS protected mode only):
preload_tiles  control whether tiles get pre-loaded into RAM at the
               start of the game.  Doing so enhances performance
               of the tile graphics, but uses more memory.        [TRUE]

Any Boolean option can be negated by prefixing it with a '!' or 'no'.


Compound options are written as option_name:option_value.

Compound options which can be set during the game are:

boulder       override the default boulder symbol with another default: [`]
disclose      the types of information you want offered at the end of the
              game  [ni na nv ng nc]
fruit         the name of a fruit you enjoy eating  [slime mold]
              (basically a whimsy which NetHack uses from time to time).
menustyle     user interface for selection of multiple objects:
              Traditional -- one object at a time prompting;
              Combination -- prompt for classes of interest, then menu;
              Partial     -- skip class prompt, use menu of all objects;
              Full        -- menu for classes of interest, then object menu;
              only the first letter ('T','C','P','F') matters; 'N' (None)
              is a synonym for 'T', as is boolean style negation  [Full]
packorder     a list of default symbols for kinds of objects that gives the
              order in which your pack will be displayed  [")[%?+!=/(*`0_]
              (If you specify only some kinds of items, the others from the
              default order will be appended to the end.)
pickup_burden when you pick up an item that exceeds this encumberance
              level (Unburdened, Burdened, streSsed, straiNed, overTaxed,
              or overLoaded), you will be asked if you want to continue. [S]
pickup_types  a list of default symbols for kinds of objects to autopickup
              when that option is on  [all]
runmode       controls how often the map window is updated when performing
              multi-step movement (various running modes or travel command):
              teleport -- don't update map until movement stops;
              run      -- periodically update map (interval is seven steps);
              walk     -- update map after every step;
              crawl    -- like walk, but delay after making each step.
              (This only affects screen display, not actual movement.)  [run]
scores        the parts of the score list you wish to see when the game ends
              You choose a combination of top scores, scores around the top
              scores, and all of your own scores.  [!own/3 top/2 around]
suppress_alert disable various version-specific warnings about changes
              in game play or the user interface, such as notification given
              for engravings that reading is now done via 'r.'
              (e.g., use suppress_alert:0.0.7 to stop that and any other
              notifications added in that version or earlier) default: [(none)]
tileset       the name of a predefined (with TILESET=) tileset to use.  This
              option may be negated (eg., !tileset) or set to an emty value
              to disable tiles.  If the windowing port does not support the
              named tileset then a suitable alternative will be used.
              [depends on windowing port]

Compound options which may be set only on startup are:

align      Your starting alignment (align:lawful, align:neutral,
           or align:chaotic).  You may specify just the first letter.  [RANDOM]
catname    the name of your first cat  [NONE]
dogname    the name of your first dog  [NONE]
dungeon    a list of symbols to be used in place of the default ones for
           drawing the dungeon.
           The symbols are subjected to a fair amount of processing, so
           that you can use C-style escapes such as \n or \081 as well as
           indicate control characters by ^x or meta characters by \Mx.
           As usual, \ can force the next character to be taken literally.
           Since many of the default symbols are overloaded, they are
           given here by name instead of symbol, with some added notes:
           stone                               (solid rock, normally ' ')

menucolor  Set colors for menus. (menucolor:"regex_string"=color)
           If boolean option ``menucolors'' is true, menus will be shown
           with different colors.
           For example, setting ``menucolor:" blessed "=green'' shows
           all lines in a menu with the text " blessed " in green.
           The string is matched using regular expressions.
           Valid values for the color are black, red, green, brown, blue,
           magenta, cyan, gray, orange, lightgreen, yellow, lightblue,
           lightmagenta, lightcyan and white.
           You can define menucolor as many times as you wish; those
           defined later will take precedence.
           Setting menucolor has effect only if TEXTCOLOR and MENU_COLOR
           were set at compile time.  [NONE]
menu_*     create single character accelerators for menu commands.  Below

role       Your starting role (e.g., role:Barbarian, role:Valk).
           Although you can specify just the first letter(s), it will
           choose only the first role it finds that matches; thus, it
           is recommended that you spell out as much of the role name
           as possible.  You can also still denote your role by
           appending it to the "name" option (e.g., name:Vic-V), but the
           "role" option will take precedence.  [RANDOM]

                    (Copyright 1989 M. Stephenson)

               (Based on the BISON general public license,
                   copyright 1988 Richard M. Stallman)

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license, but changing it is not allowed.  You can also use this wording to
 make the terms for other programs.

  The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of
those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is intended to give
everyone the right to share NetHack.  To make sure that you get the rights we
want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you
these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  Hence this license
agreement.

  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
copies of NetHack, that you receive source code or else can get it if you
want it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute copies
of NetHack, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you
must tell them their rights.

  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out
that there is no warranty for NetHack.  If NetHack is modified by someone
else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is
not what we distributed.

  Therefore we (Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights) make
the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or
change NetHack.


                        COPYING POLICIES

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of NetHack source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you keep intact the notices on
all files that refer to copyrights, to this License Agreement, and to the
absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack
program a copy of this License Agreement along with the program.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and
copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above
(including distributing this License Agreement), provided that you also do the
following:

    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
    changed the files and the date of any change; and

    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is a derivative of NetHack or any part
    thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties on terms
    identical to those contained in this License Agreement (except that you
    may choose to grant more extensive warranty protection to some or all
    third parties, at your option)

    c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
    transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection
    in exchange for a fee.

  3. You may copy and distribute NetHack (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) accompany it with the complete machine-readable source code, which
    must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with full information as to how to obtain the complete
    machine-readable source code from an appropriate archive site.  (This
    alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution.)

For these purposes, complete source code means either the full source
distribution as originally released over Usenet or updated copies of the
files in this distribution used to create the object code or executable.

  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack except as
expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt otherwise to
copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack is void and your rights to
use the program under this License agreement shall be automatically
terminated.  However, parties who have received computer software programs
from you with this License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated
so long as such parties remain in full compliance.


Stated plainly:  You are permitted to modify NetHack, or otherwise use parts
of NetHack, provided that you comply with the conditions specified above;
in particular, your modified NetHack or program containing parts of NetHack
must remain freely available as provided in this License Agreement.  In
other words, go ahead and share NetHack, but don't try to stop anyone else
from sharing it farther.
Read Your Fortune
  For 50 zorkmids, the gypsy will draw a random card.  If your
  card is a suited card, you get a special fortune.  Trump cards
  each have specific effects, good or bad.

  There is no skill involved with this service; however, the
  most useful effects have an extra cost that can be only paid
  by credit.  For this reason, you may want to play the other
  games first to win enough credit for a good outcome.


Three-Card Monte
  "Let me show you the easiest game to win.  I've got these three
  cards: the ace of swords, two of swords, and three of swords.
  Watch me shuffle them in front of you.  Are you looking carefully?
  Good.  Now can you tell me which one is the ace?  That's right!
  Wasn't that easy?  Would you like to win some credit?  Just
  place a bet, and if you can pick the ace again, I'll pay your
  bet."

  Actually, it doesn't matter how carefully you watch the gypsy --
  by using slight of hand, she can control whether you win or lose.
  Your chances of winning may increase or decrease as you continue
  to play the game, depending upon whether the gypsy thinks you are
  "hooked" on the game.


Ninety-Nine
  After placing a bet, you and the gypsy are each dealt three cards.
  You alternate turns with the gypsy in which you must play one card
  from your hand, adjust a total depending on the card you played,
  and then draw a new card.  The object of the game is to force your
  opponent to play a card that makes the total less than zero or more
  than niney-nine.  The effects of the cards upon the total are as
  follows:
    Ace           Adds 1 to the total.
    2 through 10  Adds the card's value to the total.
    Jack, Queen   Subtracts 10 from the total.
    King          Raises the total to 99.  Always safe to play.
    Fool          Raises the total to 100.  Always loses.
    Other trumps  No change to the total.  Always safe to play.
  You are the first to play.  If there are no more cards left to draw
  from, you win.


Yendorian Tarocchi
  This game is still under construction, and will be released in
  a future version.

  Tarot cards originated for the purpose of playing Tarocchi, an
  Italian trick-based card game.  (Their use in fortunetelling
  and the occult began much later.)  Tarocchi has been adapted
  and renamed by other cultures: Tarot (France), Tarok (Danish),
  Troccas (Switzerland), and so on.


Pawn Gems
  You can sell valuable gems to gypsies for credit.


About the Cards
Our deck of playing cards is derived from several different European
card systems.  The Italian card system is the oldest, believed to be
imported from India, Persia, or Arabia circa 1370.  (Note that although
playing cards were invented in China, scholarly evidence indicates
that they had no direct influence on European cards.  Also, cards did
not appear in Europe until long after Marco Polo or the Crusades, so
it is unlikely that they were introduced by these travellers.)  Tarot
cards were invented during the 15th century for the purpose of playing
trick-taking card games.  They were not associated with Gypsies or the
occult until the 18th century.  Finally, there is the French card system,
which has been widely adopted by the English-speaking world.

The deck can be divided into two parts.  There are 52 "suited" cards
that are very similar to the familiar French system (4 suits with 13 ranks);
in a Tarot deck, these are called the "minor arcana".  The other part
of the deck are the "trump" cards, which are called the "major arcana" in
a Tarot deck.

Our suits are named "swords", "wands", "shields", and "rings".  These
are assigned by matching the Tarot suits to their closest equivalent
NetHack object.  Interestingly, there are two "offensive" suits (swords,
wands), two "defensive" suits (shields, rings), two "ordinary" suits
(swords, shields), and two "magical" suits (wands, rings).

          1.  Introduction

               Recently,  you  have  begun to find yourself unfulfilled and
          distant in your daily occupation.  Strange dreams of prospecting,
          stealing,  crusading,  and  combat have haunted you in your sleep
          for many months, but you aren't sure of the reason.   You  wonder
          whether  you have in fact been having those dreams all your life,
          and somehow managed to forget about them until now.  Some  nights
          you awaken suddenly and cry out, terrified at the vivid recollec-
          tion of the strange and powerful creatures that seem to be  lurk-
          ing  behind  every  corner  of  the dungeon in your dream.  Could
          these details haunting your dreams be real?  As each night  pass-
          es,  you feel the desire to enter the mysterious caverns near the
          ruins grow stronger.  Each morning, however, you quickly put  the
          idea  out  of  your head as you recall the tales of those who en-
          tered the caverns before you and did not return.  Eventually  you
          can  resist  the yearning to seek out the fantastic place in your
          dreams no longer.  After all, when other  adventurers  came  back
          this  way after spending time in the caverns, they usually seemed
          better off than when they passed through the first time.  And who
          was to say that all of those who did not return had not just kept
          going?


               Asking around, you hear about a bauble, called the Amulet of
          Yendor  by  some, which, if you can find it, will bring you great
          wealth.  One legend you were told even mentioned that the one who
          finds  the  amulet  will be granted immortality by the gods.  The
          amulet is rumored to be somewhere beyond the Valley of  Gehennom,
          deep  within  the Mazes of Menace.  Upon hearing the legends, you
          immediately realize that there is some profound and  undiscovered
          reason that you are to descend into the caverns and seek out that
          amulet of which they spoke.  Even if the rumors of  the  amulet's
          powers are untrue, you decide that you should at least be able to
          sell the tales of your adventures to the local  minstrels  for  a
          tidy  sum,  especially if you encounter any of the terrifying and
          magical creatures of your dreams along the way.   You  spend  one
          last  night  fortifying  yourself at the local inn, becoming more
          and more depressed as you watch the odds of  your  success  being


          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                              1





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                              2



          posted on the inn's walls getting lower and lower.


                 In the morning you awake, collect your belongings, and set
          off for the dungeon.  After several days  of  uneventful  travel,
          you  see the ancient ruins that mark the entrance to the Mazes of
          Menace.  It is late at night, so you make camp  at  the  entrance
          and  spend the night sleeping under the open skies.  In the morn-
          ing, you gather your gear, eat what may be your  last  meal  out-
          side, and enter the dungeon...


          2.  What is going on here?

               You  have  just  begun  a game of SLASH'EM.  Your goal is to
          grab as much treasure as you can, retrieve the Amulet of  Yendor,
          and escape the Mazes of Menace alive.

               Your abilities and strengths for dealing with the hazards of
          adventure will vary with your background and training:

               Archeologists understand dungeons pretty well; this  enables
          them  to  move  quickly  and sneak up on the local nasties.  They
          start equipped with the tools for a proper scientific expedition.

               Barbarians  are  warriors out of the hinterland, hardened to
          battle.   They  begin  their  quests  with  naught  but  uncommon
          strength, a trusty hauberk, and a great two-handed sword.

               Cavemen  and  Cavewomen start with exceptional strength but,
          unfortunately, with neolithic weapons.

               Flame Mages have managed to harness mystical  energies  into
          the  control  of  the element of fire.  Notwithstanding their pet
          hell hounds,  woe be unto anyone who  stands  in  the  way  of  a
          skilled mage casting a fireball.

               Healers  are wise in medicine and apothecary.  They know the
          herbs and simples that can restore  vitality,  ease  pain,  anes-
          thetize, and neutralize poisons; and with their instruments, they
          can divine a being's state of health or sickness.  Their  medical
          practice earns them quite reasonable amounts of money, with which
          they enter the dungeon.

               Ice Mages command the forces of cold.  An  experienced  Mage
          can  summon  great blizzards yet remain unaffected by the turmoil
          of the elements.

               Knights are distinguished  from  the  common  skirmisher  by
          their  devotion  to  the ideals of chivalry and by the surpassing
          excellence of their armor.

               Monks are ascetics, who by rigorous practice of physical and
          mental disciplines have become capable of fighting as effectively


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                              3



          without weapons as with.  They wear no armor but make up  for  it
          with increased mobility.

               Necromancers  have  delved  into  the darkest of the magical
          lore, and mastered some of the  most  forbidden  of  the  magical
          lore.  Many have fallen to the armies of the undead that they are
          capable of bringing forth and controlling.

               Priests and Priestesses are clerics militant, crusaders  ad-
          vancing  the  cause  of  righteousness with arms, armor, and arts
          thaumaturgic.  Their ability to commune with deities  via  prayer
          occasionally extricates them from peril, but can also put them in
          it.

               Rangers are most at home in the woods, and some say slightly
          out of place in a dungeon.  They are, however, experts in archery
          as well as tracking and stealthy movement.

               Rogues are agile and stealthy  thieves,  with  knowledge  of
          locks,  traps,  and  poisons.  They specialize in surprise, which
          they employ to great advantage.

               Samurai are the elite warriors of feudal Nippon.   They  are
          heavily  armored  but  quick, and wear the dai-sho, two swords of
          the deadliest keenness.

               Tourists start out with lots of gold (suitable for  shopping
          with),  a  credit card, lots of food, some maps, and an expensive
          camera.  Most monsters don't like being photographed.

               Undead Slayers are specialists,  trained to hunt the  undead
          as  well  as  other incarnations of evil.  They are well aware of
          the weaknesses of their foes and come prepared.  Few denizens  of
          darkness  ever  encounter such warriors of light and live to tell
          of it.

               Valkyries are hardy warrior women.  Their upbringing in  the
          harsh  Northlands  makes  them strong, inures them to extremes of
          cold, and instills in them stealth and cunning.

               Wizards start out with a knowledge of magic, a selection  of
          magical  items,  and a particular affinity for dweomercraft.  Al-
          though seemingly weak and easy to overcome at first sight, an ex-
          perienced Wizard is a deadly foe.

               Yeomen are sturdy fighters. They are famed for their ability
          to stand doing nothing for hours. It is said that this is because
          they  are  none  too bright. Yeomen can both take a lot of damage
          and inflict it on others.

               You may also choose the race of your character:

               Doppelgangers have the anviable ability to  change  form  at
          will,   at  a  cost  of some mystic energy (mana),  although what


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                              4



          they become may be a bit of a surprise,  even for them.

               Dwarves are smaller than humans or elves, but are stocky and
          solid  individuals.   Dwarves'  most notable trait is their great
          expertise in mining and metalwork.  Dwarvish armor is said to  be
          second in quality not even to the mithril armor of the Elves.

               Elves  and Drows are agile, quick, and perceptive; very lit-
          tle of what goes on will escape an Elf.   The  quality  of  Elven
          craftsmanship often gives them an advantage in arms and armor.

               Gnomes  are  smaller  than but generally similar to dwarves.
          Gnomes are known to be expert miners, and it is known that a  se-
          cret  underground  mine  complex built by this race exists within
          the Mazes of Menace, filled with both riches and danger.

               Hobbits are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though they
          are  inclined  to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily, they are
          nonetheless nimble and deft in their movements. A love of  learn-
          ing  (other  than  genealogical  lore)  is far from general among
          them. Hobbits are difficult to daunt, or to kill, and at need can
          still handle arms.

               Humans are by far the most common race of the surface world,
          and are thus the norm by which other races  are  often  compared.
          Although  they have no special abilities, they can succeed in any
          role.

               Lycanthropes are wild beasts who draw  their  strength  from
          the  phases of the moon,  and can transform into wolves when they
          channel their magical energies.  Even unarmed,  a Lycanthrope  is
          a  savage fighter,  as many scarred by their deadly claws can at-
          test.

               Orcs are a cruel and barbaric race that  hate  every  living
          thing  (including other orcs).  Above all others, Orcs hate Elves
          with a passion unequalled, and will go out of their way  to  kill
          one  at  any opportunity.  The armor and weapons fashioned by the
          Orcs are typically of inferior quality.

               Vampires strike fear into the heart of many. Their super-hu-
          man strength, notorious dexterity and resiliance make them diffi-
          cult to defeat while their almost hypnotic charm makes them  dan-
          gerous  opponents.  Even  their own Gods treat vampires with some
          distaste.

          3.  What do all those things on the screen mean?

               On the screen is kept a map of where you have been and  what
          you  have  seen on the current dungeon level; as you explore more
          of the level, it appears on the screen in front of you.

               When SLASH'EM's ancestor rogue first  appeared,  its  screen
          orientation  was  almost  unique  among  computer  fantasy games.


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                              5



          Since then, screen orientation has become the  norm  rather  than
          the  exception;  SLASH'EM  continues this fine tradition.  Unlike
          text adventure games that accept commands in pseudo-English  sen-
          tences  and  explain  the results in words, SLASH'EM commands are
          all one or two keystrokes and the results are  displayed  graphi-
          cally  on  the  screen.   A minimum screen size of 24 lines by 80
          columns is recommended; if the screen is  larger,  only  a  21x80
          section will be used for the map.

               SLASH'EM  can  even be played by blind players, with the as-
          sistance of Braille readers or speech synthesisers.  Instructions
          for configuring SLASH'EM for the blind are included later in this
          document.

               SLASH'EM generates a new dungeon every  time  you  play  it;
          even  the authors still find it an entertaining and exciting game
          despite having won several times.

               SLASH'EM offers a variety of display options.   The  options
          available  to  you  will vary from port to port, depending on the
          capabilities of your hardware and software, and  whether  various
          compile-time options were enabled when your executable was creat-
          ed.  The three possible display options are: a monochrome charac-
          ter  interface,  a color character interface, and a graphical in-
          terface using small pictures called tiles.  The two character in-
          terfaces allow fonts with other characters to be substituted, but
          the default assignments use standard ASCII characters  to  repre-
          sent everything.  There is no difference between the various dis-
          play options with respect to game play.  Because we cannot repro-
          duce the tiles or colors in the Guidebook, and because it is com-
          mon to all ports, we will use the default ASCII  characters  from
          the  monochrome  character  display  when referring to things you
          might see on the screen during your game.

               In order to understand what is going on in  SLASH'EM,  first
          you  must understand what SLASH'EM is doing with the screen.  The
          SLASH'EM screen replaces the ``You see ...'' descriptions of text
          adventure  games.  Figure 1 is a sample of what a SLASH'EM screen
          might look like.  The way the screen looks  for  you  depends  on
          your platform.

          3.1.  The status lines (bottom)

               The  bottom  two lines of the screen contain several cryptic
          pieces of information describing your current status.  If  either
          status  line  becomes  longer  than  the width of the screen, you
          might not see all of it.  Here are explanations of what the vari-
          ous status items mean (though your configuration may not have all
          the status items listed below):

          Rank
               Your character's name and professional ranking (based on the
               experience level, see below).

          Strength
               A  measure of your character's strength; one of your six ba-
               sic attributes.  A human character's  attributes  can  range
               from  3  to 18 inclusive; non-humans may exceed these limits
               (occasionally you may get super-strengths of the form 18/xx,
               and  magic  can  also  cause attributes to exceed the normal
               limits).  The higher your strength, the  stronger  you  are.
               Strength  affects  how  successfully  you  perform  physical
               tasks, how much damage you do in combat, and how  much  loot
               you can carry.

          Dexterity
               Dexterity  affects  your  chances to hit in combat, to avoid
               traps, and do other tasks requiring agility or  manipulation
               of objects.

          Constitution
               Constitution  affects  your ability to recover from injuries
               and other strains on your stamina.

          Intelligence
               Intelligence affects your ability to cast  spells  and  read
               spellbooks.

          Wisdom
               Wisdom comes from your practical experience (especially when
               dealing with magic).  It affects your magical energy.

          Charisma
               Charisma affects how certain creatures react toward you.  In
               particular,  it can affect the prices shopkeepers offer you.

          Alignment
               Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic.  Often, Lawful is taken as good


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                              7



               and Chaotic as evil, but legal and ethical do not always co-
               incide.  Your alignment influences how other monsters  react
               toward you.  Monsters of a like alignment are more likely to
               be non-aggressive, while those of an opposing alignment  are
               more likely to be seriously offended at your presence.

          Dungeon Level
               How deep you are in the dungeon.  You start at level one and
               the number increases as you  go  deeper  into  the  dungeon.
               Some  levels  are  special, and are identified by a name and
               not a number.  The Amulet of Yendor is reputed to  be  some-
               where beneath the twentieth level.

          Gold
               The  number  of  gold  pieces you are openly carrying.  Gold
               which you have concealed in containers is not counted.

          Hit Points
               Your current and maximum hit points.   Hit  points  indicate
               how  much  damage you can take before you die.  The more you
               get hit in a fight, the lower they get.  You can regain  hit
               points  by  resting,  or  by  using certain magical items or
               spells.  The number in parentheses  is  the  maximum  number
               your hit points can reach.

          Power
               Spell  points.  This tells you how much mystic energy (mana)
               you have available for spell casting.  Again,  resting  will
               regenerate the amount available.

          Armor Class
               A measure of how effectively your armor stops blows from un-
               friendly creatures.  The lower this number is, the more  ef-
               fective the armor; it is quite possible to have negative ar-
               mor class.

          Experience
               Your current experience level and experience points.  As you
               adventure,  you  gain experience points.  At certain experi-
               ence point totals, you gain an experience level.   The  more
               experienced you are, the better you fight and withstand mag-
               ical attacks.  Many dungeons show only your experience level
               here.

          Weight
               The  total  weight of all items in your inventory, displayed
               if you have the showweight option set. The number after  the
               slash is your carrying capacity.

          Time
               The  number  of  turns elapsed so far, displayed if you have
               the time option set.

          Hunger status
               Your current hunger status, ranging from  Satiated  down  to
               Fainting.   If  your hunger status is normal, it is not dis-
               played.

               Additional status flags may appear after the hunger  status:
          Conf  when you're confused, FoodPois or Ill when sick, Blind when
          you can't see, Stun when stunned, and Hallu when hallucinating.

          3.2.  The message line (top)

               The top line of the screen is reserved for messages that de-
          scribe  things that are impossible to represent visually.  If you
          see a ``--More--'' on the top line, this means that SLASH'EM  has
          another  message  to  display on the screen, but it wants to make
          certain that you've read the one that is there  first.   To  read
          the next message, just press the space bar.

          3.3.  The map (rest of the screen)

               The  rest  of the screen is the map of the level as you have
          explored it so far.  Each symbol on the screen  represents  some-
          thing.   You  can  set various graphics options to change some of
          the symbols the game uses; otherwise, the game will  use  default
          symbols.  Here is a list of what the default symbols mean:

          - and |
               The walls of a room, or an open door.  Or a grave (|).

          .    The floor of a room, ice, or a doorless doorway.

          #    A  corridor,  or iron bars, or a tree, or possibly a kitchen
               sink (if your dungeon has sinks), or a drawbridge.

          >    Stairs down: a way to the next level.

          <    Stairs up: a way to the previous level.

          +    A closed door, or a spellbook containing a spell you may  be
               able to learn.

          @    Your character or a human.

          $    A pile of gold.

          ^    A trap (once you have detected it).

          )    A weapon.

          [    A suit or piece of armor.

          %    Something edible (not necessarily healthy).

          ?    A scroll.

          /    A wand.

          =    A ring.

          !    A potion.

          (    A useful item (pick-axe, key, lamp...).

          "    An amulet or a spider web.

          *    A gem or rock (possibly valuable, possibly worthless).

          `    A boulder or statue.

          0    An iron ball.

          _    An altar, or an iron chain.

          {    A fountain.

          }    A pool of water or moat or a pool of lava.

          \    An opulent throne.

          a-zA-Z and other symbols
               Letters  and certain other symbols represent the various in-
               habitants of the Mazes of Menace.  Watch out,  they  can  be
               nasty and vicious.  Sometimes, however, they can be helpful.

          I    This marks the last known location of an invisible or other-
               wise  unseen  monster.   Note  that  the  monster could have
               moved.  The 'F' and 'm' commands may be useful here.

               You need not memorize all these symbols;  you  can  ask  the
          game  what  any  symbol  represents with the `/' command (see the
          next section for more info).


          4.  Commands

               Commands are initiated by  typing  one  or  two  characters.
          Some  commands, like ``search'', do not require that any more in-
          formation be collected by SLASH'EM.  Other commands might require
          additional  information, for example a direction, or an object to
          be used.  For those commands that require additional information,
          SLASH'EM will present you with either a menu of choices or with a
          command line prompt requesting information.  Which you  are  pre-
          sented with will depend chiefly on how you have set the menustyle
          option.

               For example, a common question, in the form  ``What  do  you
          want  to use? [a-zA-Z ?*]'', asks you to choose an object you are


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             10



          carrying.  Here, ``a-zA-Z'' are the  inventory  letters  of  your
          possible  choices.   Typing  `?'  gives  you an inventory list of
          these items, so you can see what each letter refers to.  In  this
          example,  there  is  also a `*' indicating that you may choose an
          object not on the list, if you wanted to use something  unexpect-
          ed.  Typing a `*' lists your entire inventory, so you can see the
          inventory letters of every object you're carrying.   Finally,  if
          you change your mind and decide you don't want to do this command
          after all, you can press the ESC key to abort the command.

               Some commands allow you to choose an object that you are not
          currently  carrying. Such commands have an extra option available
          as in ``What do you want to drink? [fgh or  ?*,.]''.  Typing  `,'
          gives  you  a  list  of the applicable objects on the floor, from
          which you may make your choice.  For commands where it is  possi-
          ble  to  choose  your current location rather than an object, the
          `.' option will be displayed. This can be used to read an engrav-
          ing or drink from a dungeon feature.

               You  can  put  a  number before some commands to repeat them
          that many times; for example, ``10s'' will search ten times.   If
          you have the number_pad option set, you must type `n' to prefix a
          count, so the example above  would  be  typed  ``n10s''  instead.
          Commands  for  which  counts make no sense ignore them.  In addi-
          tion, movement commands can be prefixed for greater control  (see
          below).  To cancel a count or a prefix, press the ESC key.

               The  list  of commands is rather long, but it can be read at
          any time during the game through the `?' command, which  accesses
          a  menu  of  helpful  texts.  As well,  there is now a menusystem
          available through the '`' command for those who would rather page
          through  menus than hunt and peck for keys. Here are the commands
          for your reference:

          ESC  Cancel the current operation (where applicable) or skip mes-
               sages.  If the menu_on_esc option is set, then this key will
               access the menusystem when  pressed  while  the  program  is
               waiting for a command.

          ?    Help menu:  display one of several help texts available.

          `    Main menu:  access the menusystem.

          /    Tell  what a symbol represents.  You may choose to specify a
               location or type a symbol (or even a whole word) to explain.
               Specifying a location is done by moving the cursor to a par-
               ticular spot on the map and then pressing one of  `.',  `,',
               `;',  or `:'.  `.' will explain the symbol at the chosen lo-
               cation, conditionally check for ``More info?'' depending up-
               on whether the help option is on, and then you will be asked
               to pick another location; `,' will explain  the  symbol  but
               skip  any  additional  information; `;' will skip additional
               info and also not bother asking you to choose another  loca-
               tion  to  examine;  `:'  will  show additional info, if any,


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003

               without asking for confirmation.  When picking  a  location,
               pressing  the ESC key will terminate this command, or press-
               ing `?'  will give a brief reminder about how it works.

               Specifying a name rather than a location  always  gives  any
          additional information available about that name.

          &    Tell what a command does.

          <    Go  up  to  the previous level (if you are on a staircase or

               der).

               Go  one  step in the direction indicated (see Figure 2).  If
               you sense or remember a monster there, you  will  fight  the
               monster  instead.   Only  these  one-step  movement commands
               cause  you  to  fight  monsters;  the  others  (below)   are
               ``safe.''

          m[yuhjklbn]
               Prefix:  move without picking up objects or  fighting  (even
               if you remember a monster there)

          F[yuhjklbn]
               Prefix:   fight  a  monster  (even  if you only guess one is
               there)

          M[yuhjklbn]
               Prefix:  move far, no pickup.

          g[yuhjklbn]
               Prefix:  move until something interesting is found.

          G[yuhjklbn] or <CONTROL->[yuhjklbn]
               Prefix:  same as `g', but forking of corridors is  not  con-
               sidered interesting.

          _    Travel to a map location via a shortest-path algorithm.  The
               shortest path is computed over map locations the hero  knows
               about  (e.g.  seen or previously traversed).  If there is no
               known path, a guess is made instead.  Stops on most  of  the
               same  conditions  as the `G' command, but without picking up
               objects, similar to the `M' command.  For ports  with  mouse
               support,  the  command  is  also  invoked when a mouse-click
               takes place on a location other than the current position.

               off)  to take off only one piece of armor or `R' (remove) to
               take off only one accessory.

          ^A   Redo the previous command.

          ^B   Borrow (steal) money from an adjacent monster.

          c    Close a door.

          C    Call (name) an individual monster.

          ^C   Panic button.  Quit the game.

          d    Drop something.  Ex. ``d7a'' means drop seven items  of  ob-
               ject a.

          D    Drop several things.  In answer to the question ``What kinds
               of things do you want to drop? [!%= BUCXaium]''  you  should
               type  zero  or  more object symbols possibly followed by `a'
               and/or `i' and/or `u' and/or `m'.  In addition, one or  more
               of the blessed/uncursed/cursed groups may be typed.

                    DB  - drop all objects known to be blessed.
                    DU  - drop all objects known to be uncursed.
                    DC  - drop all objects known to be cursed.
                    DX  - drop all objects of unknown B/U/C status.
                    Da  - drop all objects, without asking for confirmation.
                    Di  - examine your inventory before dropping anything.
                    Du  - drop only unpaid objects (when in a shop).
                    Dm  - use a menu to pick which object(s) to drop.
                    D%u - drop only unpaid food.

          ^D   Kick something (usually a door).

          e    Eat  food.  Vampires  cannot  eat as such. However, they can
               gain nutrition by draining blood from  fresh  corpses  using
               this command.

          E    Engrave   a  message  on  the  floor.   Engraving  the  word

               is often useful to give yourself a breather.  (This  feature
               may  be  compiled out of the game, so your version might not
               have it.)

          O    Set options.  A menu showing the current option values  will
               be  displayed.  You can change most values simply by select-
               ing the menu entry for the given option (ie, by  typing  its
               letter  or  clicking  upon it, depending on your user inter-
               face).  For the  non-boolean  choices,  a  further  menu  or
               prompt will appear once you've closed this menu.  The avail-
               able options are listed later in  this  Guidebook.   Options
               are  usually  set  before  the game rather than with the `O'
               command; see the section on options below.

          p    Pay your shopping bill/Shopkeeper services.

          P    Put on a ring or other accessory (amulet, blindfold).

               messages.  The behavior can be varied via the msg_window op-
               tion.

          q    Quaff (drink) something (potion, water, etc).

          Q    Select an object for your quiver.  You can then  throw  this
               using the `f' command.  (In SLASH'EM versions prior to 0.0.6
               this was the command to quit the game, which  has  now  been
               moved to `#quit'.)

          5.  Rooms and corridors

               Rooms  and  corridors in the dungeon are either lit or dark.
          Any lit areas within your line of sight will be  displayed;  dark
          areas  are  only  displayed  if they are within one space of you.
          Walls and corridors remain on the map as you explore them.

               Secret corridors are hidden.  You can find them with the `s'
          (search) command.

          5.1.  Doorways

               Doorways connect rooms and corridors.  Some doorways have no
          doors; you can walk right through.  Others have  doors  in  them,
          which may be open, closed, or locked.  To open a closed door, use
          the `o' (open) command; to close it again, use  the  `c'  (close)
          command.

               You  can  get  through a locked door by using a tool to pick
          the lock with the `a' (apply) command, or by kicking it open with


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             19



          the `^D' (kick) command.

               Open  doors  cannot be entered diagonally; you must approach
          them straight on, horizontally or vertically.   Doorways  without
          doors are not restricted in this fashion.

               Doors  can  be  useful for shutting out monsters.  Most mon-
          sters cannot open doors, although a few don't need to (ex. ghosts
          can walk through doors).

               Secret  doors  are  hidden.   You can find them with the `s'
          (search) command.  Once found they are in all ways equivalent  to
          normal doors.

          5.2.  Traps (`^')

               There  are  traps throughout the dungeon to snare the unwary
          delver.  For example, you may suddenly fall into  a  pit  and  be
          stuck for a few turns trying to climb out.  Traps don't appear on
          your map until you see one triggered by moving onto it, see some-
          thing fall into it, or you discover it with the `s' (search) com-
          mand.  Monsters can fall prey to traps, too, which can be a  very
          useful defensive strategy.

               There is a special pre-mapped branch of the dungeon based on
          the classic computer game ``Sokoban.''  The goal is to  push  the
          boulders  into  the pits or holes.  With careful foresight, it is
          possible to complete all of the levels according  to  the  tradi-
          tional  rules  of Sokoban.  Some allowances are permitted in case
          the player gets stuck; however, they will lower your luck.

          5.3.  Stairs (`<', `>')

               In general, each level in the dungeon will have a  staircase
          going up (`<') to the previous level and another going down (`>')
          to the next level.  There are some exceptions  though.   For  in-
          stance,  fairly  early  in the dungeon you will find a level with
          two down staircases, one continuing into the dungeon and the oth-
          er  branching  into  an  area  known as the Gnomish Mines.  Those
          mines eventually hit a dead end, so after exploring them (if  you
          choose  to  do so), you'll need to climb back up to the main dun-
          geon.

               When you traverse a set of stairs, or trigger a  trap  which
          sends  you to another level, the level you're leaving will be de-
          activated and stored in a file on disk.  If you're  moving  to  a
          previously visited level, it will be loaded from its file on disk
          and reactivated.  If you're moving to a level which has  not  yet
          been  visited,  it  will be created (from scratch for most random
          levels, from a template for some ``special''  levels,  or  loaded
          from  the  remains  of  an  earlier game for a ``bones'' level as
          briefly described below).  Monsters are only active on  the  cur-
          rent  level;  those  on  other levels are essentially placed into
          stasis.


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             20



               Ordinarily when you climb a set of stairs, you  will  arrive
          on  the  corresponding  staircase  at your destination.  However,
          pets (see below) and some other monsters  will  follow  along  if
          they're close enough when you travel up or down stairs, and occa-
          sionally one of these creatures  will  displace  you  during  the
          climb.  When that occurs, the pet or other monster will arrive on
          the staircase and you will end up nearby.

          5.4.  Ladders (`<', `>')

               Ladders serve the same purpose as staircases,  and  the  two
          types  of  inter-level  connections  are nearly indistinguishable
          during game play.

          5.5.  Shops and shopping

               Occasionally you will run across a room  with  a  shopkeeper
          near  the  door  and  many items lying on the floor.  You can buy
          items by picking them up and then using the `p' command.  You can
          inquire  about the price of an item prior to picking it up by us-
          ing the ``#chat'' command while standing on it.   Using  an  item
          prior  to  paying  for it will incur a charge, and the shopkeeper
          won't allow you to leave the shop until you have  paid  any  debt
          you owe.

               You  can  sell items to a shopkeeper by dropping them to the
          floor while inside a shop.  You will either be offered an  amount
          of  gold  and  asked whether you're willing to sell, or you'll be
          told that the shopkeeper isn't interested (generally,  your  item
          needs  to  be  compatible with the type of merchandise carried by
          the shop).

               If you drop something in a shop by accident, the  shopkeeper
          will  usually  claim ownership without offering any compensation.
          You'll have to buy it back if you want to reclaim it.

               Shopkeepers sometimes run out of money.  When that  happens,
          you'll  be  offered  credit  instead of gold when you try to sell
          something.  Credit can be used to pay for purchases,  but  it  is
          only  good  in  the shop where it was obtained; other shopkeepers
          won't honor it.  (If you happen to find a "credit  card"  in  the
          dungeon, don't bother trying to use it in shops; shopkeepers will
          not accept it.)

               The `$' command, which reports the amount of  gold  you  are
          carrying (in inventory, not inside bags or boxes), will also show
          current shop debt or credit, if any.  The `Iu' command lists  un-
          paid items (those which still belong to the shop) if you are car-
          rying any.  The `Ix' command shows an inventory-like  display  of
          any  unpaid  items which have been used up, along with other shop
          fees, if any.

          5.5.1.  Shop idiosyncracies

               Several aspects of shop behavior might be unexpected.

          * The price of a given item can vary due to a variety of factors.

          * A  shopkeeper treats the spot immediately inside the door as if
            it were outside the shop.

          * While the shopkeeper watches you like a hawk, he will generally
            ignore any other customers.

          * If  a  shop  is "closed for inventory", it will not open of its
            own accord.

          * Shops do not get restocked with new items, regardless of inven-
            tory depletion.


          6.  Monsters

               Monsters you cannot see are not  displayed  on  the  screen.
          Beware!   You  may  suddenly come upon one in a dark place.  Some
          magic items can help you  locate  them  before  they  locate  you
          (which some monsters can do very well).

               The  commands  `/' and `;' may be used to obtain information
          about those monsters who are displayed on the screen.   The  com-
          mand  `C'  allows you to assign a name to a monster, which may be
          useful to help distinguish one from another  when  multiple  mon-
          sters  are  present.  Assigning a name which is just a space will
          remove any prior name.

               The extended command ``#chat'' can be used to interact  with
          an  adjacent monster.  There is no actual dialog (in other words,
          you don't get to choose what you'll say), but chatting with  some
          monsters such as a shopkeeper or the Oracle of Delphi can produce
          useful results.

          6.1.  Fighting

               If you see a monster and you wish to fight it, just  attempt
          to  walk  into  it.   Many  monsters you find will mind their own
          business unless you attack them.  Some of them are very dangerous
          when angered.  Remember:  discretion is the better part of valor.

               If you can't see a monster (if it is invisible,  or  if  you
          are  blinded), the symbol `I' will be shown when you learn of its
          presence.  If you attempt to walk into it, you will try to  fight
          it  just  like a monster that you can see; of course, if the mon-
          ster has moved, you will attack empty air.  If you guess that the
          monster  has  moved  and you don't wish to fight, you can use the
          `m' command to move without fighting; likewise, if you don't  re-
          member a monster but want to try fighting anyway, you can use the


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             22



          `F' command.

          6.2.  Your pet

               You start the game with a little dog (`d'), cat (`f'),  hell
          hound  pup  ('d'),  winter  wolf  cub ('d'), ghoul ('Z'), or pony
          (`u'), which follows you about the dungeon  and  fights  monsters
          with  you.   With the exception of ghouls, your pet needs food to
          survive.  It usually feeds itself  on  fresh  carrion  and  other
          meats.   If  you're worried about it or want to train it, you can
          feed it, too, by throwing it food.  A properly trained pet can be
          very useful under certain circumstances.

               Your  pet  also  gains experience from killing monsters, and
          can grow over time, gaining hit points  and  doing  more  damage.
          Initially,  your  pet  may  even be better at killing things than
          you, which makes pets useful for low-level characters.

               Your pet will follow you up and down  staircases  if  it  is
          next  to  you when you move.  Otherwise your pet will be stranded
          and may become wild.  Similarly, when you trigger  certain  types
          of  traps  which  alter  your location (for instance, a trap door
          which drops you to a lower dungeon level), any adjacent pet  will
          accompany you and any non-adjacent pet will be left behind.  Your
          pet may trigger such traps itself; you will not be carried  along
          with it even if adjacent at the time.

          6.3.  Steeds

               Some  types of creatures in the dungeon can actually be rid-
          den if you have the right equipment and skill.  Convincing a wild
          beast  to  let  you  saddle  it up is difficult to say the least.
          Many a dungeoneer has had to resort to magic and wizardry in  or-
          der to forge the alliance.  Once you do have the beast under your
          control however, you can easily climb in and out  of  the  saddle
          with the `#ride' command.  Lead the beast around the dungeon when
          riding, in the same manner as you would move yourself.  It is the
          beast that you will see displayed on the map.

               Riding  skill is managed by the `#enhance' command.  See the
          section on Weapon proficiency for more information about that.

          6.4.  Bones levels

               You may encounter the shades and corpses of other  adventur-
          ers (or even former incarnations of yourself!) and their personal
          effects.  Ghosts are hard to  kill,  but  easy  to  avoid,  since
          they're  slow and do little damage.  You can plunder the deceased
          adventurer's possessions; however, they are likely to be  cursed.
          Beware of whatever killed the former player; it is probably still
          lurking around, gloating over its last victory.

          7.  Objects

               When you find something in the dungeon, it is common to want
          to  pick  it up.  In SLASH'EM, this is accomplished automatically
          by walking over the object (unless you turn  off  the  autopickup
          option  (see below), or move with the `m' prefix (see above)), or
          manually by using the `,' command.

               If you're carrying too many items, SLASH'EM will tell you so
          and  you  won't  be able to pick up anything more.  Otherwise, it
          will add the object(s) to your pack and tell you  what  you  just
          picked up.

               As  you add items to your inventory, you also add the weight
          of that object to your load.  The amount that you can  carry  de-
          pends  on  your strength and your constitution.  The stronger you
          are, the less the additional load will affect you.  There comes a
          point,  though, when the weight of all of that stuff you are car-
          rying around with you through  the  dungeon  will  encumber  you.
          Your  reactions  will get slower and you'll burn calories faster,
          requiring food more frequently  to  cope  with  it.   Eventually,
          you'll  be  so overloaded that you'll either have to discard some
          of what you're carrying or collapse under its weight.

               SLASH'EM will tell you how badly you have  loaded  yourself.
          The  symbols  `Burdened', `Stressed', `Strained', `Overtaxed' and
          `Overloaded' are displayed on the bottom line display to indicate
          your condition.

               When you pick up an object, it is assigned an inventory let-
          ter.  Many commands that operate on objects must ask you to  find
          out  which  object  you  want  to use.  When SLASH'EM asks you to
          choose a particular object you are carrying, you are usually pre-
          sented  with a list of inventory letters to choose from (see Com-
          mands, above).

               Some objects, such as weapons,  are  easily  differentiated.
          Others,  like  scrolls  and potions, are given descriptions which
          vary according to type.  During a game, any two objects with  the
          same  description  are  the same type.  However, the descriptions
          will vary from game to game.

               When you use one of these objects, if its effect is obvious,
          SLASH'EM  will  remember what it is for you.  If its effect isn't
          extremely obvious, you will be asked what you want to  call  this
          type  of object so you will recognize it later.  You can also use
          the ``#name'' command for the same purpose at any time,  to  name
          all  objects  of  a particular type or just an individual object.
          When you use ``#name'' on an object which has already been named,
          specifying  a  space  as the value will remove the prior name in-
          stead of assigning a new one.

          7.1.  Curses and Blessings

               Any object that you find may be cursed, even if  the  object
          is otherwise helpful.  The most common effect of a curse is being
          stuck with (and to) the item.  Cursed weapons weld themselves  to
          your  hand  when wielded, so you cannot unwield them.  Any cursed
          item you wear is not removable by ordinary means.   In  addition,
          cursed  arms and armor usually, but not always, bear negative en-
          chantments that make them less effective in combat.  Other cursed
          objects may act poorly or detrimentally in other ways.

               Objects  can  also  be  blessed.  Blessed items usually work
          better or more beneficially than normal uncursed items.  For  ex-
          ample, a blessed weapon will do more damage against demons.

               There are magical means of bestowing or removing curses upon
          objects, so even if you are stuck with one, you  can  still  have
          the  curse  lifted and the item removed.  Priests and Priestesses
          have an innate sensitivity to this property  in  any  object,  so
          they  can  more  easily avoid cursed objects than other character
          roles.

               An item with unknown status will be reported in your  inven-
          tory with no prefix.  An item which you know the state of will be
          distinguished in your inventory  by  the  presence  of  the  word
          ``cursed'', ``uncursed'' or ``blessed'' in the description of the
          item.

          7.2.  Weapons (`)')

               Given a chance, most monsters in the Mazes  of  Menace  will
          gratuitously  try to kill you.  You need weapons for self-defense
          (killing them first).  Without a weapon,  you  do  only  1-2  hit
          points  of damage (plus bonuses, if any).  Monk characters are an
          exception; they normally do much more damage with bare hands than
          they do with weapons.

               There are wielded weapons, like maces and swords, and thrown
          weapons, like arrows and spears.  To hit monsters with a  weapon,
          you  must wield it and attack them, or throw it at them.  You can
          simply elect to throw a spear.

               To shoot an arrow, you should first wield a bow, then  throw
          the  arrow.  An alternative method would be wield a bow and place
          the arrows in your Quiver, after which you fire  the  ammunition.
          Rangers  and  the  like  may find that having a bow as their sec-
          ondary weapon is a useful combination. In order  to  use  a  sec-
          ondary  weapon to fire ammunition however, it must first be moved
          to the primary weapon slot. The ``x'' command  is  available  for
          this use.  Crossbows shoot crossbow bolts.  Slings hurl rocks and
          (other) stones (like gems).

               Enchanted weapons have a ``plus'' (or ``to hit enhancement''
          which  can  be  either  positive  or  negative) that adds to your


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             25



          chance to hit and the damage you do to a monster.  The  only  way
          to determine a weapon's enchantment is to have it magically iden-
          tified somehow.  Most weapons are subject to some type of  damage
          like rust.  Such ``erosion'' damage can be repaired.

               The  chance  that an attack will successfully hit a monster,
          and the amount of damage such a hit will do,  depends  upon  many
          factors.   Among them are: type of weapon, quality of weapon (en-
          chantment and/or erosion), experience level, strength, dexterity,
          encumbrance,  and  proficiency  (see below).  The monster's armor
          class - a general defense rating, not necessarily due to  wearing
          of  armor - is a factor too; also, some monsters are particularly
          vulnerable to certain types of weapons.

               Many weapons can be wielded in one hand; some  require  both
          hands.   When  wielding  a  two-handed weapon, you can not wear a
          shield, and vice versa.  When wielding a one-handed  weapon,  you
          can  have  another  weapon ready to use by setting things up with
          the `x' command, which exchanges  your  primary  (the  one  being
          wielded)  and  alternate weapons.  And if you have proficiency in
          the ``two weapon combat'' skill, you may wield both  weapons  si-
          multaneously  as  primary and secondary; use the `#twoweapon' ex-
          tended command to engage or disengage that.  Only some  types  of
          characters  (barbarians,  for  instance) have the necessary skill
          available.  Even with that skill, using two weapons at  once  in-
          curs a penalty in the chance to hit your target compared to using
          just one weapon at a time.

               There might be times when you'd rather not wield any  weapon
          at  all.  To accomplish that, wield `-', or else use the `A' com-
          mand which allows you to unwield the current weapon  in  addition
          to taking off other worn items.

               Those  of you in the audience who are AD&D players, be aware
          that each weapon which existed in AD&D does roughly the same dam-
          age  to  monsters  in SLASH'EM.  Some of the more obscure weapons
          (such as the aklys, lucern hammer, and bec-de-corbin) are defined
          in an appendix to Unearthed Arcana, an AD&D supplement.

               The  commands  to  use weapons are `w' (wield), `t' (throw),
          `f' (fire, an alternative way of  throwing),  `Q'  (quiver),  `x'
          (exchange), `#twoweapon', and `#enhance' (see below).

          7.2.1.  Throwing and shooting

               You  can  throw just about anything via the `t' command.  It
          will prompt for the item to throw; picking `?' will  list  things
          in  your  inventory  which are considered likely to be thrown, or
          picking `*' will list your entire inventory.  After you've chosen
          what  to  throw, you will be prompted for a direction rather than
          for a specific target.  The distance something can be thrown  de-
          pends mainly on the type of object and your strength.  Arrows can
          be thrown by hand, but can be thrown much  farther  and  will  be
          more likely to hit when thrown while you are wielding a bow.


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             26



               You  can  simplify  the  throwing operation by using the `Q'
          command to select your preferred ``missile'', then using the  `f'
          command  to  throw  it.   You'll  be  prompted for a direction as
          above, but you don't have to specify which  item  to  throw  each
          time you use `f'.  There is also an option, autoquiver, which has
          SLASH'EM choose another item to automatically  fill  your  quiver
          when the inventory slot used for `Q' runs out.

               Some  characters have the ability to fire a volley of multi-
          ple items in a single turn.  Knowing how to load  several  rounds
          of ammunition at once -- or hold several missiles in your hand --
          and still hit a target is not an easy task.   Rangers  are  among
          those  who are adept at this task, as are those with a high level
          of proficiency in the relevant weapon  skill  (in  bow  skill  if
          you're  wielding one to shoot arrows, in crossbow skill if you're
          wielding one to shoot bolts, or in sling skill if you're wielding
          one to shoot stones).  The number of items that the character has
          a chance to fire varies from turn to turn.   You  can  explicitly
          limit  the  number  of shots by using a numeric prefix before the
          `t' or `f' command.  For example, ``2f''  (or  ``n2f''  if  using
          number_pad mode) would ensure that at most 2 arrows are shot even
          if you could have fired 3.  If you specify a larger  number  than
          would have been shot (``4f'' in this example), you'll just end up
          shooting the same number (3, here) as if no limit had been speci-
          fied.  Once the volley is in motion, all of the items will travel
          in the same direction; if the first ones kill a monster, the oth-
          ers can still continue beyond that spot.

          7.2.2.  Weapon proficiency

               You will have varying degrees of skill in the weapons avail-
          able.  Weapon proficiency, or weapon skills, affect how well  you
          can  use  particular  types of weapons, and you'll be able to im-
          prove your skills as you progress through a  game,  depending  on
          your role, your experience level, and use of the weapons.

               For  the  purposes of proficiency, weapons have been divided
          up  into  various  groups  such  as  daggers,  broadswords,   and
          polearms.   Each  role has a limit on what level of proficiency a
          character can achieve for each group.  For instance, wizards  can
          become  highly  skilled in daggers or staves but not in swords or
          bows.

               The `#enhance' extended command is used  to  review  current
          weapons  proficiency (also spell proficiency) and to choose which
          skill(s) to improve when you've used one or more skills enough to
          become eligible to do so.  The skill rankings are ``none'' (some-
          times also referred to as ``restricted'', because  you  won't  be
          able  to  advance),  ``unskilled'',  ``basic'',  ``skilled'', and
          ``expert''.  Restricted skills simply will not appear in the list
          shown  by  `#enhance'.   (Divine  intervention might unrestrict a
          particular skill, in which case it will start at unskilled and be
          limited  to basic.)  Some characters can enhance their barehanded
          combat or martial arts  skill  beyond  expert  to  ``master''  or


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             27



          ``grand master''.

               Use of a weapon in which you're restricted or unskilled will
          incur a modest penalty in the chance to hit a monster and also in
          the  amount of damage done when you do hit; at basic level, there
          is no penalty or bonus; at skilled level, you  receive  a  modest
          bonus  in  the chance to hit and amount of damage done; at expert
          level, the bonus is higher.  A successful hit  has  a  chance  to
          boost  your  training towards the next skill level (unless you've
          already reached the limit for this skill).   Once  such  training
          reaches  the  threshold  for that next level, you'll be told that
          you feel more confident in your skills.  At that  point  you  can
          use  `#enhance'  to increase one or more skills.  Such skills are
          not increased automatically because there is a limit to your  to-
          tal  overall  skills, so you need to actively choose which skills
          to enhance and which to ignore.

          7.3.  Armor (`[')

               Lots of unfriendly things lurk about; you need armor to pro-
          tect yourself from their blows.  Some types of armor offer better
          protection than others.  Your armor class is a  measure  of  this
          protection.  Armor class (AC) is measured as in AD&D, with 10 be-
          ing the equivalent of no armor, and lower numbers meaning  better
          armor.   Each  suit  of armor which exists in AD&D gives the same
          protection in SLASH'EM.  Here is an (incomplete) list of the  ar-
          mor classes provided by various suits of armor:

                             dragon scale mail         1
                             plate mail                3
                             crystal plate mail        3
                             bronze plate mail         4
                             splint mail               4
                             banded mail               4
                             dwarvish mithril-coat     4
                             elven mithril-coat        5
                             chain mail                5
                             orcish chain mail         6
                             scale mail                6
                             studded leather armor     7
                             ring mail                 7
                             orcish ring mail          8
                             leather armor             8
                             leather jacket            9
                             no armor                 10

               You can also wear other pieces of armor (ex. helmets, boots,
          shields, cloaks) to lower your armor class even further, but  you
          can  only  wear one item of each category (one suit of armor, one
          cloak, one helmet, one shield, and so on) at a time.

               If a piece of armor is enchanted, its armor protection  will
          be  better  (or  worse)  than normal, and its ``plus'' (or minus)
          will subtract from your armor class.  For  example,  a  +1  chain


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             28



          mail  would  give  you  better protection than normal chain mail,
          lowering your armor class one unit further to 4.  When you put on
          a  piece  of  armor, you immediately find out the armor class and
          any ``plusses'' it provides.  Cursed pieces of armor usually have
          negative enchantments (minuses) in addition to being unremovable.

               Many types of armor are subject to some kind of damage  like
          rust.   Such damage can be repaired.  Some types of armor may in-
          hibit spell casting.

               The commands to use armor are `W' (wear) and `T' (take off).
          The  `A'  command  can  also be used to take off armor as well as
          other worn items.

          7.4.  Food (`%')

               Food is necessary to survive.  If you go  too  long  without
          eating  you  will  faint, and eventually die of starvation.  Some
          types of food will spoil, and become unhealthy  to  eat,  if  not
          protected.  Food stored in ice boxes or tins (``cans'') will usu-
          ally stay fresh, but ice boxes are heavy, and tins take  a  while
          to open.

               When you kill monsters, they usually leave corpses which are
          also ``food.''  Many, but not all, of these are edible; some also
          give  you special powers when you eat them.  A good rule of thumb
          is ``you are what you eat.''

               Some character roles and some monsters are vegetarian.  Veg-
          etarian  monsters  will typically never eat animal corpses, while
          vegetarian players can, but with some rather unpleasant  side-ef-
          fects.

               You  can  name one food item after something you like to eat
          with the fruit option.

               The command to eat food is `e'.

          7.5.  Scrolls (`?')

               Scrolls are labeled with various titles, probably chosen  by
          ancient  wizards  for  their amusement value (ex. ``READ ME,'' or
          ``THANX MAUD'' backwards).  Scrolls disappear after you read them
          (except for blank ones, without magic spells on them).

               One  of  the most useful of these is the scroll of identify,
          which can be used to determine what another object is, whether it
          is  cursed  or  blessed, and how many uses it has left.  Some ob-
          jects of subtle enchantment are  difficult  to  identify  without
          these.

               A mail daemon may run up and deliver mail to you as a scroll
          of mail (on versions compiled with this feature).   To  use  this
          feature  on versions where SLASH'EM mail delivery is triggered by


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             29



          electronic mail appearing in your system mailbox,  you  must  let
          SLASH'EM  know where to look for new mail by setting the ``MAIL''
          environment variable to the file name of your mailbox.   You  may
          also  want  to set the ``MAILREADER'' environment variable to the
          file name of your favorite reader, so SLASH'EM can  shell  to  it
          when  you read the scroll.  On versions of SLASH'EM where mail is
          randomly generated internal to the game, these environment  vari-
          ables  are  ignored.   You can disable the mail daemon by turning
          off the mail option.

               The command to read a scroll is `r'.

          7.6.  Potions (`!')

               Potions are distinguished by the color of the liquid  inside
          the flask.  They disappear after you quaff them.

               Clear  potions  are  potions  of water.  Sometimes these are
          blessed or cursed, resulting in holy or unholy water.  Holy water
          is  the  bane  of  the  undead, so potions of holy water are good
          things to throw (`t') at them.  It is also sometimes very  useful
          to dip (``#dip'') an object into a potion.

               The command to drink a potion is `q' (quaff).

          7.7.  Wands (`/')

               Magic  wands  usually  have  multiple magical charges.  Some
          wands are directional--you must give a direction in which to  zap
          them.   You can also zap them at yourself (just give a `.' or `s'
          for the direction). Be warned, however, for this is often unwise.
          Other  wands  are nondirectional--they don't require a direction.
          The number of charges in a wand is random and  decreases  by  one
          whenever you use it.

               When  the number of charges left in a wand becomes zero, at-
          tempts to use the wand will usually result in nothing  happening.
          Occasionally, however, it may be possible to squeeze the last few
          mana points from an otherwise spent wand, destroying  it  in  the
          process.   A  wand  may be recharged by using suitable magic, but
          doing so runs the risk of causing it to explode.  The chance  for
          such  an  explosion starts out very small and increases each time
          the wand is recharged.

               In a truly desperate situation, when your back is up against
          the  wall,  you might decide to go for broke and break your wand.
          This is not for the faint of heart.  Doing so  will  almost  cer-
          tainly cause a catastrophic release of magical energies.

               When  you have fully identified a particular wand, inventory
          display will include additional information in  parentheses:  the
          number  of  times  it  has been recharged followed by a colon and
          then by its current number of charges.  A current charge count of
          -1 is a special case indicating that the wand has been cancelled.


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             30



               The command to use a wand is `z' (zap).  To break  one,  use
          the `a' (apply) command.

          7.8.  Rings (`=')

               Rings  are very useful items, since they are relatively per-
          manent magic, unlike the usually  fleeting  effects  of  potions,
          scrolls, and wands.

               Putting  on  a  ring activates its magic.  You can wear only
          two rings, one on each ring finger.

               Most rings also cause you to grow hungry more  rapidly,  the
          rate varying with the type of ring.

               The commands to use rings are `P' (put on) and `R' (remove).

          7.9.  Spellbooks (`+')

               Spellbooks are tomes of mighty magic.  When studied with the
          `r'  (read) command, they transfer to the reader the knowledge of
          a spell (and therefore eventually become  unreadable)  --  unless
          the  attempt  backfires.   Reading a cursed spellbook or one with
          mystic runes beyond your ken can be harmful to your health!

               A spell (even when learned) can also backfire when you  cast
          it.   If  you  attempt to cast a spell well above your experience
          level, or if you have little skill  with  the  appropriate  spell
          type,  or  cast  it at a time when your luck is particularly bad,
          you can end up wasting both the energy and the time  required  in
          casting.

               Casting  a  spell  calls  forth magical energies and focuses
          them with your naked mind.  Some of the magical  energy  released
          comes  from  within  you, and casting several spells in a row may
          tire you.  Casting of spells also requires practice.  With  prac-
          tice,  your skill in each category of spell casting will improve.
          Over time, however, your memory of each spell will dim if you  do
          not  use it, and you will need to relearn it. Casting a spell re-
          inforces your memory of it, so you may never need  to  relearn  a
          frequently used spell.

               Some  spells  are  directional--you must give a direction in
          which to cast them.  You can also cast  them  at  yourself  (just
          give  a  `.'  or  `s' for the direction). Be warned, however, for
          this is often  unwise.   Other  spells  are  nondirectional--they
          don't require a direction.

               Just as weapons are divided into groups in which a character
          can become proficient (to varying degrees), spells are  similarly
          grouped.  Successfully casting a spell exercises the skill group;
          sufficient skill may increase the potency of the spell and reduce
          the  risk  of spell failure.  Skill slots are shared with weapons
          skills.  (See also the section on ``Weapon proficiency''.)


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             31



               Casting a spell also requires flexible movement, and wearing
          various types of armor may interfere with that.

               The  command to read a spellbook is the same as for scrolls,
          `r' (read).  The `+' command lists  your  current  spells,  their
          levels, categories, and chances for failure.  The `Z' (cast) com-
          mand casts a spell.  The ``#enhance'' extended  command  advances
          your spellcasting skills.

          7.10.  Tools (`(')

               Tools are miscellaneous objects with various purposes.  Some
          tools have a limited number of uses, akin to wand  charges.   For
          example,  lamps burn out after a while.  Other tools are contain-
          ers, which objects can be placed into or taken out of.

               The command to use tools is `a' (apply).

          7.10.1.  Containers

               You may encounter bags, boxes, and chests in  your  travels.
          A  tool  of  this  sort can be opened with the ``#loot'' extended
          command when you are standing on top of it (that is, on the  same
          floor  spot), or with the `a' (apply) command when you are carry-
          ing it.  However, chests are often locked, and are  in  any  case
          unwieldy  objects.   You must set one down before unlocking it by
          using a key or lock-picking tool with the `a' (apply) command, by
          kicking  it  with the `^D' command, or by using a weapon to force
          the lock with the ``#force'' extended command.

               Some chests are trapped, causing nasty things to happen when
          you unlock or open them.  You can check for and try to deactivate
          traps with the ``#untrap'' extended command.

          7.11.  Amulets (`"')

               Amulets are very similar to rings, and often more  powerful.
          Like rings, amulets have various magical properties, some benefi-
          cial, some harmful, which are activated by putting them on.

               Only one amulet may be worn at a time, around your neck.

               The commands to use amulets are the same as for  rings,  `P'
          (put on) and `R' (remove).

          7.12.  Gems (`*')

               Some  gems  are valuable, and can be sold for a lot of gold.
          They are also a far more efficient way of carrying  your  riches.
          Valuable gems increase your score if you bring them with you when
          you exit.

               Other small rocks are also categorized as gems, but they are
          much   less  valuable.   All  rocks,  however,  can  be  used  as


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             32



          projectile weapons (if you have a sling).  In the most  desperate
          of cases, you can still throw them by hand.

          7.13.  Large rocks (``')

               Statues  and  boulders  are not particularly useful, and are
          generally heavy.  It is rumored that some statues  are  not  what
          they seem.

               Very  large humanoids (giants and their ilk) have been known
          to use boulders as weapons.

          7.14.  Gold (`$')

               Gold adds to your score, and you can  buy  things  in  shops
          with  it.  There are a number of monsters in the dungeon that may
          be influenced by the amount of gold you are carrying (shopkeepers
          aside).


          8.  Conduct

               As  if  winning  SLASH'EM were not difficult enough, certain
          players seek to challenge themselves by imposing restrictions  on
          the  way  they play the game.  The game automatically tracks some
          of these challenges, which can be checked at any  time  with  the
          #conduct  command or at the end of the game.  When you perform an
          action which breaks a challenge, it will  no  longer  be  listed.
          This gives players extra ``bragging rights'' for winning the game
          with these challenges.  Note that it is perfectly  acceptable  to
          win  the game without resorting to these restrictions and that it
          is unusual for players to adhere to  challenges  the  first  time
          they win the game.

               Several  of  the  challenges are related to eating behavior.
          The most difficult of these is the foodless challenge.   Although
          creatures can survive long periods of time without food, there is
          a physiological need for water; thus there is no  restriction  on
          drinking  beverages,  even  if they provide some minor food bene-
          fits.  Calling upon your god for help with  starvation  does  not
          violate any food challenges either.

               A  strict  vegan  diet  is one which avoids any food derived
          from animals.  The primary source of nutrition is fruits and veg-
          etables.  The corpses and tins of blobs (`b'), jellies (`j'), and
          fungi (`F') are also considered to be vegetable matter.   Certain
          human  food  is  prepared without animal products; namely, lembas
          wafers, cram rations, food rations (gunyoki), K-rations,  and  C-
          rations.   Metal  or another normally indigestible material eaten
          while polymorphed into a creature that can digest it is also con-
          sidered  vegan  food.   Note however that eating such items still
          counts against foodless conduct.




          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             33



               Vegetarians do not eat animals; however, they are  less  se-
          lective  about eating animal byproducts than vegans.  In addition
          to the vegan items listed above, they may eat any kind of pudding
          (`P') other than the black puddings, eggs and food made from eggs
          (fortune cookies and pancakes), food made with milk  (cream  pies
          and candy bars), and lumps of royal jelly.  Monks are expected to
          observe a vegetarian diet.

               Eating any kind of meat violates the vegetarian, vegan,  and
          foodless  conducts.   This includes tripe rations, the corpses or
          tins of any monsters not mentioned above, and the  various  other
          chunks  of meat found in the dungeon.  Swallowing and digesting a
          monster while polymorphed is treated as if you ate the creature's
          corpse.   Eating  leather, dragon hide, or bone items while poly-
          morphed into a creature that can digest  it,  or  eating  monster
          brains while polymorphed into a mind flayer, is considered eating
          an animal, although wax is only an animal byproduct.

               Regardless of conduct, there will be some  items  which  are
          indigestible,  and  others  which  are hazardous to eat.  Using a
          swallow-and-digest attack against a monster is equivalent to eat-
          ing the monster's corpse.  Please note that the term ``vegan'' is
          used here only in the context of diet.  You  are  still  free  to
          choose  not  to  use  or  wear  items  derived from animals (e.g.
          leather, dragon hide, bone, horns, coral), but the game will  not
          keep track of this for you.  Also note that ``milky'' potions may
          be a translucent white, but they do not contain milk, so they are
          compatible  with  a  vegan  diet.   Slime molds or player-defined
          ``fruits'', although they could be anything from ``cherries''  to
          ``pork chops'', are also assumed to be vegan.

               An atheist is one who rejects religion.  This means that you
          cannot #pray, #offer sacrifices to  any  god,  #turn  undead,  or
          #chat  with  a  priest.  Particularly selective readers may argue
          that playing Monk or Priest characters should violate  this  con-
          duct;  that  is a choice left to the player.  Offering the Amulet
          of Yendor to your god is necessary to win the  game  and  is  not
          counted against this conduct.  You are also not penalized for be-
          ing spoken to by an angry god, priest(ess),  or  other  religious
          figure; a true atheist would hear the words but attach no special
          meaning to them.

               Most players fight with a wielded weapon (or  tool  intended
          to be wielded as a weapon).  Another challenge is to win the game
          without using such a wielded weapon.  You are still permitted  to
          throw,  fire,  and kick weapons; use a wand, spell, or other type
          of item; or fight with your hands and feet.

               In SLASH'EM, a pacifist refuses to cause the  death  of  any
          other  monster  (i.e. if you would get experience for the death).
          This is a particularly difficult challenge, although it is  still
          possible to gain experience by other means.




          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             34



               An illiterate character cannot read or write.  This includes
          reading a scroll, spellbook, fortune cookie message, or  t-shirt;
          writing a scroll; or reading (or making) an engraving of anything
          other than a single ``x'' (the traditional signature of an illit-
          erate  person).  Reading any item that is absolutely necessary to
          win the game is not counted against this conduct.   The  identity
          of  scrolls  and  spellbooks  (and  knowledge  of spells) in your
          starting inventory is assumed to be learned  from  your  teachers
          prior to the start of the game and isn't counted.

               There  are several other challenges tracked by the game.  It
          is possible to eliminate one or more species of monsters by geno-
          cide;  playing  without  this  feature is considered a challenge.
          When the game offers you an opportunity to genocide monsters, you
          may  respond  with  the  monster type ``none'' if you want to de-
          cline.  You can change the form of an item into another  item  of
          the  same type (``polypiling'') or the form of your own body into
          another creature (``polyself'') by  wand,  spell,  or  potion  of
          polymorph; avoiding these effects are each considered challenges.
          Polymorphing monsters, including pets, does not break  either  of
          these  challenges.   Finally, you may sometimes receive wishes; a
          game without an attempt to wish for any items is a challenge,  as
          is  a  game without wishing for an artifact (even if the artifact
          immediately disappears).  When the game offers you an opportunity
          to  make  a  wish  for an item, you may choose ``nothing'' if you
          want to decline.


          9.  Options

               Due to variations in personal tastes and conceptions of  how
          SLASH'EM  should  do  things,  there  are  options you can set to
          change how SLASH'EM behaves.

          9.1.  Setting the options

               Options may be set in a number of ways.   Within  the  game,
          the `O' command allows you to view all options and change most of
          them.  You can also set options automatically by placing them  in
          the  SLASHEMOPTIONS  environment  variable  or in a configuration
          file.  Some versions of SLASH'EM  also  have  front-end  programs
          that allow you to set options before starting the game.

          9.2.  Using the SLASHEMOPTIONS environment variable

               The  SLASHEMOPTIONS  variable  is  a comma-separated list of
          initial values for the various options.  Some can only be  turned
          on  or  off.   You turn one of these on by adding the name of the
          option to the list, and turn it off by typing a `!' or ``no'' be-
          fore  the  name.  Others take a character string as a value.  You
          can set string options by typing the  option  name,  a  colon  or
          equals sign, and then the value of the string.  The value is ter-
          minated by the next comma or the end of string.



          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             35



               For example, to set up an environment variable so that ``au-
          toquiver''  is  on,  ``autopickup''  is  off,  the name is set to
          ``Blue Meanie'', and the fruit is set to  ``papaya'',  you  would
          enter the command

               % setenv SLASHEMOPTIONS "autoquiver,\!autopickup,name:Blue Meanie,fruit:papaya"

          in  csh  (note the need to escape the ! since it's special to the
          shell), or

               $ SLASHEMOPTIONS="autoquiver,!autopickup,name:Blue Meanie,fruit:papaya"
               $ export SLASHEMOPTIONS

          in sh or ksh.

          9.3.  Using a configuration file

               Any  line  in  the  configuration  file starting with `#' is
          treated as a comment.  Any line in the configuration file  start-
          ing  with ``OPTIONS='' may be filled out with options in the same
          syntax as in  SLASHEMOPTIONS.   Any  line  starting  with  ``DUN-
          GEON='',  ``EFFECTS='',  ``MONSTERS='', ``OBJECTS='', ``TRAPS='',
          or ``BOULDER='' is taken as defining the  corresponding  dungeon,
          effects, monsters, objects traps or boulder option in a different
          syntax, a sequence of decimal numbers giving the character  posi-
          tion  in the current font to be used in displaying each entry.  A
          zero in any entry in such a sequence leaves the display  of  that
          entry  unchanged;  this feature is not available using the option
          syntax.  Such a sequence can be continued to  multiple  lines  by
          putting  a `\' at the end of each line to be continued.  Any line
          starting with ``TILESET='' defines a tile set in the same  syntax
          as  in  SLASHEMOPTIONS  (although the options are different). See
          the section on tile sets, below, for more information.

               If your copy of the game included the compile time AUTOPICK-
          UP_EXCEPTIONS  option,  then  any  line starting with ``AUTOPICK-
          UP_EXCEPTION='' is taken as defining an exception  to  the  pick-
          up_types  option.  There is a section of this Guidebook that dis-
          cusses that.

               The default name of the configuration file varies on differ-
          ent operating systems, but SLASHEMOPTIONS can also be set to  the
          full  name  of  a  file  you want to use (possibly preceded by an
          `@').

          9.4.  Customization options

               Here are explanations of what the various options do.  Char-
          acter  strings  that  are too long may be truncated.  Some of the
          options listed may be inactive in your dungeon.

          align
               Your starting  alignment  (align:lawful,  align:neutral,  or
               align:chaotic).  You may specify just the first letter.  The


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             36



            default  is  to randomly pick an appropriate alignment.  Cannot
            be set with the `O' command.

          autodig
            Automatically dig if you are wielding a digging tool and moving
            into a place that can be dug (default false).

          autopickup
            Automatically  pick up things onto which you move (default on).
            See pickup_types to refine the behavior.

          autoquiver
               This  option  controls what happens when you attempt the `f'
            (fire)  command  with an empty quiver.  When true, the computer
            will fill your quiver with some suitable weapon.  Note that  it
            will  not take into account the blessed/cursed status, enchant-
            ment, damage, or quality of the weapon; you are free to manual-
            ly fill your quiver with the `Q' command instead.  If no weapon
            is found or the option is false, the `t' (throw) command is ex-
            ecuted instead.  (default false)

          boulder
               Set the character used to display boulders (default is  rock
               class symbol).

          catname
            Name your starting cat (ex. ``catname:Morris'').  Cannot be set
            with the `O' command.

          character
            Pick  your  type of character (ex. ``character:Monk''); synonym
            for ``role''.  See ``name'' for an alternate method of specify-
            ing  your role.  Normally only the first letter of the value is
            examined; the string ``random'' is an exception.

          checkpoint
            Save game state after each level change, for possible  recovery
            after program crash (default on).

          checkspace
               Check free disk space before writing files to disk  (default
            on).  You may have to turn this off if you have more than 2  GB
            free space on the partition used for your save and level files.
            Only applies when MFLOPPY was defined during compilation.

          cmdassist
               Have the game provide some additional command assistance for
               new players if it detects some anticipated mistakes (default
               on).

          confirm
               Have user confirm attacks on pets,  shopkeepers,  and  other
               peaceable creatures (default on).

          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             37



          DECgraphics
            Use  a  predefined  selection  of  characters  from the DEC VT-
            xxx/DEC Rainbow/ANSI line-drawing character set to display  the
            dungeon/effects/traps instead of having to define a full graph-
            ics set yourself (default off).  This option also sets up prop-
            er  handling  of graphics characters for such terminals, so you
            should specify it when appropriate even if you override the se-
            lections with your own graphics strings.

          disclose
               Controls options for disclosing various information when the
            game ends (defaults to all possibilities being disclosed).  The
            possibilities are:

                    i - disclose your inventory.
                    a - disclose your attributes.
                    v - summarize monsters that have been vanquished.
                    g - list monster species that have been genocided.
                    c - display your conduct.

               Each disclosure possibility can optionally be preceded by  a
            prefix which let you refine how it behaves. Here are the  valid
            prefixes:

                    y - prompt you and default to yes on the prompt.
                    n - prompt you and default to no on the prompt.
                    - disclose it without prompting.
                    - - do not disclose it and do not prompt.

            (ex. ``disclose:yi na +v -g -c'') The example sets inventory to
            prompt and default to yes, attributes to prompt and default  to
            no,  vanquished to disclose without prompting, genocided to not
            disclose and not to prompt, conduct to not disclose and not  to
            prompt.   Note  that  the vanquished monsters list includes all
            monsters killed by traps and each other as well as by you.

          dogname
            Name your starting dog (ex. ``dogname:Fang'').  Cannot  be  set
            with the `O' command.

          dungeon
               Set the graphics symbols for displaying the dungeon (default
            `` |--------||.-|++##.##<><>_|\\##{}.}..## #}'').  The  dungeon
            option  should be followed by a string of 1-42 characters to be
            used instead of the default map-drawing characters.   The  dun-
            geon map will use the characters you specify instead of the de-
            fault symbols, and default symbols for any you do not  specify.
            Remember  that  you may need to escape some of these characters
            on a command line if they are special to your shell.

            Note that SLASH'EM escape-processes this option string in  con-
            ventional  C  fashion.  This means that `\' is a prefix to take
            the following character literally.  Thus `\' needs to be repre-
            sented  as  `\\'.  The special escape form `\m' switches on the


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             38



            meta bit in the following character, and the `^' prefix  causes
            the following character to be treated as a control character.

            The  order of the symbols is:  solid rock, vertical wall, hori-
            zontal wall, upper left corner, upper right corner, lower  left
            corner, lower right corner, cross wall, upward T wall, downward
            T wall, leftward T wall, rightward T wall,  no  door,  vertical
            open door, horizontal open door, vertical closed door, horizon-
            tal closed door, iron bars, tree, floor of a room, dark  corri-
            dor,  lit  corridor,  stairs up, stairs down, ladder up, ladder
            down, altar, grave, throne,  kitchen  sink,  toilet,  fountain,
            pool  or moat, ice, lava, vertical lowered drawbridge, horizon-
            tal lowered drawbridge, vertical raised drawbridge,  horizontal
            raised drawbridge, air, cloud, under water.

               You might want to use `+' for the corners and T walls for  a
            more aesthetic, boxier display.  Note that in the next release,
            new symbols may be added, or the present ones rearranged.

               Cannot be set with the `O' command.

          effects
               Set the graphics symbols for displaying special effects (de-
               fault
               ``|-\\/*!)(0#@*/-\\||\\-//-\\| |\\-//-\\| |\\-//-\\| |\\-//-\\| |\\-//-\\| |\\-//-\\| |\\-//-\\| |\\-/'').
            The effects option should be followed by a string of 1-83 char-
            acters  to be used instead of the default special-effects char-
            acters.  This string is subjected to the same processing as the
            dungeon option.

            The  order  of the symbols is:  vertical beam, horizontal beam,
            left slant, right slant, digging beam, camera flash beam,  left
            boomerang, right boomerang, four glyphs giving the sequence for
            magic resistance displays, the  eight  surrounding  glyphs  for
            swallowed  display,  nine  glyphs each for magical, fire, cold,
            death, lightning, poison and  acid  explosions.   An  explosion
            consists of three rows (top, middle, and bottom) of three char-
            acters.  The explosion is centered in the center of this 3 by 3
            array.

            Note that in the next release, new symbols may be added, or the
            present ones rearranged.

               Cannot be set with the `O' command.

          extmenu
               Changes the extended commands interface to pop-up a menu  of
            available commands.  It is keystroke compatible with the tradi-
            tional interface except that it does not require that  you  hit
            Enter.  It  is  implemented only by the tty port (default off),
            when the game has been compiled to support tty graphics.

          female
            An obsolete synonym for ``gender:female''.  Cannot be set  with


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             39



            the `O' command.

          fixinv
               An object's inventory letter sticks to it when it's  dropped
               (default on).  If this is off, dropping an object shifts all
               the remaining inventory letters.

          fruit
            Name a fruit after something you enjoy eating (ex. ``fruit:man-
            go'') (default ``slime mold'').  Basically a  nostalgic  whimsy
            that  SLASH'EM  uses from time to time.  You should set this to
            something you find more appetizing than  slime  mold.   Apples,
            oranges,  pears, bananas, and melons already exist in SLASH'EM,
            so don't use those.

          gender
            Your starting gender (gender:male or gender:female).   You  may
            specify  just  the first letter.  Although you can still denote
            your gender using the  ``male''  and  ``female''  options,  the
            ``gender'' option will take precedence.  The default is to ran-
            domly pick an appropriate gender.  Cannot be set with  the  `O'
            command.

          ghoulname
            Name your starting ghoul (ex. ``ghoulname:Casper'').  Cannot be
            set with the `O' command.

          help
            If more information is available for an object looked  at  with
            the  `/' command, ask if you want to see it (default on). Turn-
            ing help off makes just looking at  things  faster,  since  you
            aren't  interrupted with the ``More info?'' prompt, but it also
            means that you might miss some interesting and/or important in-
            formation.

          horsename
            Name  your  starting horse (ex. ``horsename:Trigger'').  Cannot
            be set with the `O' command.

          IBMgraphics
            Use a predefined selection of IBM extended ASCII characters  to
            display the dungeon/effects/traps instead of having to define a
            full graphics set yourself (default  off).   This  option  also
            sets  up proper handling of graphics characters for such termi-
            nals, so you should specify it when  appropriate  even  if  you
            override the selections with your own graphics strings.

          ignintr
               Ignore interrupt signals, including breaks (default off).

          invweight
               Display the weights of items in your inventory (and at other
               times) in braces (default off).

          keep_savefile
               Keeps the save file after restore.  SLASH'EM usually deletes
            your savefile after you restore,  making death permanent.  This
            option can allow you to restore from the  last  save.  (default
            off).

          legacy
            Display an introductory message when starting the game (default
            on).

          lit_corridor
               Show corridor squares seen by night vision or a light source
               held by your character as lit (default off).

          lootabc
            Use  the old `a', `b', and `c' keyboard shortcuts when looting,
            rather than the mnemonics `o', `i', and `b' (default off).

          mail
               Enable mail delivery during the game (default on).

          male
               An obsolete synonym for ``gender:male''.  Cannot be set with
               the `O' command.

          menustyle
            Controls the interface used when you need to choose various ob-
            jects (in response to the Drop  command,  for  instance).   The
            value  specified  should be the first letter of one of the fol-
            lowing:  traditional, combination, partial,  or  full.   Tradi-
            tional  was  the only interface available for earlier versions;
            it consists of a prompt for object class  characters,  followed
            by  an  object-by-object  prompt for all items matching the se-
            lected object class(es).  Combination starts with a prompt  for
            object  class(es)  of  interest,  but  then  displays a menu of
            matching objects rather  than  prompting  one-by-one.   Partial
            skips  the  object  class  filtering and immediately displays a
            menu of all objects.  Full displays a menu  of  object  classes
            rather than a character prompt, and then a menu of matching ob-
            jects for selection.

          menu_deselect_all
               Menu  character accelerator to deselect all items in a menu.
            Implemented by the Amiga, Gem, X11, GTK and tty ports.  Default
            '-'.

          menu_deselect_page
            Menu character accelerator to deselect all items on  this  page
            of  a  menu.  Implemented by the Amiga, Gem and tty ports.  De-
            fault '\'.

          menu_first_page
            Menu character accelerator to jump to the first page in a menu.

          menu_headings
            Controls  how  the  headings in a menu are highlighted.  Values
            are 'bold', 'inverse', or 'underline'.  Not all ports can actu-
            ally display all three types.

          menu_invert_all
            Menu  character accelerator to invert all items in a menu.  Im-
            plemented by the Amiga, Gem, X11, GTK and tty  ports.   Default
            '@'.

          menu_invert_page
            Menu  character accelerator to invert all items on this page of
            a menu.  Implemented by the Amiga, Gem and tty ports.   Default
            '~'.

          menu_last_page
            Menu  character accelerator to jump to the last page in a menu.
            Implemented by the Amiga, Gem and tty ports.  Default '|'.

          menu_next_page
            Menu character accelerator to goto the next menu page.   Imple-
            mented by the Amiga, Gem and tty ports.  Default '>'.

          menu_on_esc
            Make the ESC key a synonym for the ``' (main menu) command (de-
            fault on).

          menu_previous_page
            Menu character accelerator to goto the previous menu page.  Im-
            plemented by the Amiga, Gem and tty ports.  Default '<'.

          menu_search
            Menu  character  accelerator to search for a menu item.  Imple-
            mented by the Amiga, Gem and X11 ports.  Default ':'.

          menu_select_all
            Menu character accelerator to select all items in a menu.   Im-
            plemented  by  the Amiga, Gem, X11, GTK and tty ports.  Default
            '.'.

          menu_select_page
            Menu character accelerator to select all items on this page  of
            a  menu.  Implemented by the Amiga, Gem and tty ports.  Default
            ','.

          monsters
               Set  the characters used to display monster classes (default
               ``abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU-
               VWXYZ@ '&;:~]'').  This string is subjected to the same pro-
            cessing as the dungeon option.  The order of the symbols is ant
            or other insect, blob, cockatrice, dog or other canine, eye  or
            sphere,  feline,  gremlin, humanoid, imp or minor demon, jelly,
            kobold, leprechaun, mimic, nymph, orc, piercer, quadruped,  ro-

            unicorn, vortex, worm, xan or other mythical/fantastic  insect,
            light,  Zouthern  aminal,  angelic being, bat or bird, centaur,
            dragon, elemental, fungus or mold, gnome, giant  humanoid,  in-
            visible  monster,  jabberwock, Keystone Kop, lich, mummy, naga,
            ogre, pudding or ooze, quantum mechanic, rust  monster,  snake,
            troll,  umber  hulk,  vampire,  wraith, xorn, apelike creature,
            zombie, human, ghost, golem, demon, sea monster,  lizard,  long
            worm tail, and mimic.  Cannot be set with the `O' command.

          msghistory
               The number of top line messages to save (and recall with ^P)
               (default 20).  Cannot be set with the `O' command.

          msg_window
            Allows you to change the way recalled messages  are  displayed.
            (It  is currently implemented for tty only.)  The possible val-
            ues are:

                    s - single message (default, this was the behavior before 3.4.0).
                    c - combination, two messages as `single', then as `full'.
                    f - full window, oldest message first.
                    r - full window, newest message first.

               For backward compatibility, no value needs to  be  specified
               (which  defaults to `full'), or it can be negated (which de-
               faults to `single').

          name
               Set your character's name (defaults to your user name).  You
            can  also set your character's role by appending a dash and one
            or more letters of the role (that is, by suffixing one of -A -B
            -C  -F  -H -I -K -M -N -P -Ra -Ro -S -T -U -V -W -Y).  If -@ is
            used for the role, then a random one will be automatically cho-
            sen.  Cannot be set with the `O' command.

          news
               Read the SLASH'EM news file, if present (default on).  Since
               the news is shown at the beginning of the game,  there's  no
               point in setting this with the `O' command.

          null
               Send padding nulls to the terminal (default off).

          number_pad
            Use the number keys to move instead of [yuhjklbn] (default 0 or
            off).  (number_pad:2 invokes the old  DOS  behavior  where  `5'
            means `g', meta-`5' means `G',  and meta-`0' means `I'.)

          objects
               Set the characters used to display object  classes  (default
            ``])[="(%!?+/$*`0_.'').  This string is subjected to  the  same
            processing  as the dungeon option.  The order of the symbols is
            illegal-object (should never be  seen),  weapon,  armor,  ring,
            amulet,  tool, food, potion, scroll, spellbook, wand, gold, gem

            or rock, boulder or statue, iron ball, chain, and venom.   Can-
            not be set with the `O' command.

          packorder
               Specify  the  order  to  list  object  types   in   (default
               ``")[%?+!=/(*`0_'').   The  value of this option should be a
               string containing the symbols for the various object  types.
               Any omitted types are filled in at the end from the previous
               order.

          perm_invent
               If true, always display your current inventory in a  window.
            This only makes sense for windowing system interfaces that  im-
            plement this feature.

          pettype
               Specify the type of your initial pet, if you are  playing  a
            character class that uses multiple types of pets; or choose  to
            have  no  initial  pet  at  all.   Possible values are ``cat'',
               ``dog'' and ``none''.  Cannot be set with the `O' command.

          pickup_burden
               When  you pick up an item that would exceed this encumbrance
            level  (Unburdened, Burdened, streSsed, straiNed, overTaxed, or
            overLoaded), you will be asked if you want to  continue.   (De-
            fault `S').

          pickup_thrown
               If this boolean option is true and autopickup is on, try  to
               pick  up things that you threw, even if they aren't in pick-
               up_types.  Default is on.

          pickup_types
            Specify the object types to be picked up when autopickup is on.
            Default is all types.  If your copy of the game has the experi-
            mental  compile time option AUTOPICKUP_EXCEPTIONS included, you
            may be able  to  use  autopickup_exception  configuration  file
            lines to further refine autopickup behavior.

          prayconfirm
               Prompt for confirmation before praying (default on).

          pushweapon
            Using  the  `w' (wield) command when already wielding something
            pushes the old item into your alternate  weapon  slot  (default
            off).

          race
            Selects  your  race  (for example, ``race:human'').  Default is
               random.  Cannot be set with the `O' command.

          rest_on_space
               Make the space bar a synonym for the `.' (rest) command (de-
               fault off).


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             44



          role
            Pick your type of character (ex. ``role:Samurai''); synonym for
            ``character''.  See ``name'' for an alternate method of  speci-
            fying  your  role.  Normally only the first letter of the value
            is examined; `r' is an exception  with  ``Rogue'',  ``Ranger'',
            and ``random'' values.

          runmode
            Controls  the amount of screen updating for the map window when
            engaged in multi-turn movement (running via shift+direction  or
            control+direction  and  so  forth, or via the travel command or
            mouse click).  The possible values are:

                    teleport - update the map after movement has finished;
                    run - update the map after every seven or so steps;
                    walk - update the map after each step;
                    crawl - like walk, but pause briefly after each step.

            This option only affects the game's screen display, not the ac-
            tual  results  of moving.  The default is `run'; versions prior
            to 3.4.1 used `teleport' only.  Whether or not  the  effect  is
            noticeable will depend upon the window port used or on the type
            of terminal.

          safe_pet
            Prevent you from (knowingly) attacking your pets (default  on).

          scores
            Control  what  parts of the score list you are shown at the end
            (ex.  ``scores:5 top scores/4 around  my  score/own  scores'').
            Only  the  first  letter of each category (`t', `a', or `o') is
            necessary.

          showexp
            Show your accumulated experience points on bottom line (default
            off).

          showrace
               Display yourself as the glyph for your race, rather than the
            glyph for your role (default off).  Note that this setting  af-
            fects  only the appearance of the display, not the way the game
            treats you.

          showscore
            Show your approximate accumulated score on bottom line (default
            off).

          showdmg
            Show damage inflicted/damage received (default off).  Inflicted
            damage is only shown to characters who have become  experienced
            enough to quantify their damage.

          showweight
               Show total weight in inventory on bottom line (default off).

          silent
            Suppress terminal beeps (default on).

          sortpack
            Sort  the  pack contents by type when displaying inventory (de-
            fault on).

          sound
            Enable messages about what your character hears  (default  on).
            Note that this has nothing to do with your computer's audio ca-
            pabilities.  This option is only partly under  player  control.
            The  game toggles it off and on during and after sleep, for ex-
            ample.

          sparkle
            Display a sparkly effect when a monster (including yourself) is
            hit by an attack to which it is resistant (default on).

          standout
               Boldface monsters and ``--More--'' (default off).

          suppress_alert
            This  option may be set to a SLASH'EM version level to suppress
            alert notification messages about feature changes for that  and
            prior versions (ex. ``suppress_alert:0.0.6'').

          tiles
               This option may be set to the name of a tile set to use,  or
            specified as ``notiles'' to disable the use of tiles.  Not  all
            windowing  interfaces  support  this option. The tile set named
            must also be defined. See the section on tile sets for more in-
            formation on that.

          time
               Show the elapsed game time in turns on bottom line  (default
               off).

          timed_delay
            When pausing momentarily for display effect, such as  with  ex-
            plosions  and  moving  objects, use a timer rather than sending
            extra characters to the screen.  (Applies to ``tty''  interface
            only;  ``X11'' and ``GTK'' interfaces always uses a timer based
            delay.  The default is on if configured into the program.)

          tombstone
               Draw a tombstone graphic upon your death (default on).

          toptenwin
            Put the ending display in a SLASH'EM window instead of on  std-
            out  (default  off).   Setting this option makes the score list
            visible when a windowing version of SLASH'EM is started without
            a  parent window, but it no longer leaves the score list around
            after game end on a terminal or emulating window.

          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             46



          traps
               Set  the  graphics  symbols  for  displaying  traps (default
            ``^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^"^^^^'').   The  traps option should be fol-
            lowed by a string of 1-22 characters to be used instead of  the
            default traps characters.  This string is subjected to the same
            processing as the dungeon option.

               The  order of the symbols is: arrow trap, dart trap, falling
            rock trap, squeaky board, bear trap, land mine, rolling boulder
            trap, sleeping gas trap, rust trap, fire trap, pit, spiked pit,
            hole,  trap  door,  teleportation trap, level teleporter, magic
            portal, web, statue trap, magic trap, anti-magic  field,  poly-
            morph trap.

               Cannot be set with the `O' command.

          travel
            Allow the travel command (default on).  Turning this option off
            will prevent the game from attempting unintended moves  if  you
            make inadvertent mouse clicks on the map window.

          verbose
               Provide more commentary during the game (default on).

          windowtype
               Select which windowing system to use,  such  as  ``tty''  or
            ``X11'' (default depends on version).  Cannot be set  with  the
            `O' command.

          wolfname
               Name your starting wolf (ex. ``wolfname:Beast'').  Cannot be
               set with the `O' command.

          9.5.  Tile sets

               For  those windowing ports which support tiles (multicolored
          pictures instead of the traditional characters), tile sets can be
          defined  using  a  line  in  the  configuration  file that begins
          ``TILESET=''. There should be one tile set  definition  line  for
          each  available tile set. Once defined, tile sets can be selected
          for initial display (using the tiles option) or  dynamically  se-
          lected  during  the  game (for those windowing ports that support
          this).

               A ``TILESET'' line has the same syntax as an ``OPTION'' line
          but with the following options available:

          name
            The name of the tile set  (for  selection).  This  can  be  any
            string of characters excluding the comma. It must be specified.

          file
            The name of the file which contains the tile set. This must  be
            specified.


          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             47



          transparent
            Marks  a  tile set as being transparent (as opposed to opaque).
            Transparent tile sets allow eg., monsters to  be  displayed  on
            top  of  the background.  Tile sets must be designed to be used
            in this way in order to achieve meaningful results. This option
            is  ignored by windowing ports which do not support transparen-
            cy.

          pseudo3D
               Marks  a  tile  set as being designed for use with Mitsuhiro
            Itakura's pseudo-3D display algorithm. They are assumed to have
            an offset-X value equal to one third of the  total  tile  width
            and  an  offset-Y  value  equal  to  one half of the total tile
            height. Such tile sets are not compatible  with  standard  tile
            sets  and  while amusing effects can be created by setting this
            option incorrectly, nothing useful can be  achieved.  Windowing
            ports  that  do  not support pseudo-3D display will ignore tile
            sets with this option set.

          9.6.  Window Port Customization options

               Here  are  explanations of the various options that are used
          to customize and change the  characteristics  of  the  windowtype
          that you have chosen.  Character strings that are too long may be
          truncated.  Not all window ports will  adjust  for  all  settings
          listed  here.   You  can  safely add any of these options to your
          config file, and if the window port is capable  of  adjusting  to
          suit  your  preferences, it will attempt to do so. If it can't it
          will silently ignore it.  You can find out if an option  is  sup-
          ported  by the window port that you are currently using by check-
          ing to see if it shows up in the Options list.  Some options  are
          dynamic  and  can  be specified during the game with the `O' com-
          mand.

          align_message
            Where  to align or place the message window (top, bottom, left,
            or right)

          align_status
            Where to align or place the status window (top,  bottom,  left,
            or right).

          ascii_map
               SLASH'EM should display an ascii character map if it can.

          color
            SLASH'EM should display color if it can for different monsters,
            objects, and dungeon features

          eight_bit_tty
            SLASH'EM should pass eight-bit character values  (for  example,
            specified  with the traps option) straight through to your ter-
            minal (default off).

          font_map
            SLASH'EM should use a font by the chosen name for the map  win-
            dow.

          font_menu
            SLASH'EM should use a font by the chosen name for menu windows.

          font_message
            SLASH'EM should use a font by the chosen name for  the  message
            window.

          font_status
               SLASH'EM should use a font by the chosen name for the status
               window.

          font_text
            SLASH'EM should use a font by the chosen name for text windows.

          font_size_map
               SLASH'EM should use this size font for the map window.

          font_size_menu
               SLASH'EM should use this size font for menu windows.

          font_size_message
               SLASH'EM should use this size font for the message window.

          font_size_status
               SLASH'EM should use this size font for the status window.

          font_size_text
               SLASH'EM should use this size font for text windows.

          fullscreen
               SLASH'EM should try and display on the entire screen  rather
               than in a window.

          hilite_pet
            Visually distinguish pets from similar animals  (default  off).
            The  behavior  of  this option depends on the type of windowing
            you use.  In text windowing, text highlighting or inverse video
            is  often  used;  with tiles, generally displays a heart symbol
            near pets or a red box around the pet.

          large_font
               SLASH'EM should use a large font.

          map_mode
               SLASH'EM should display the map in the manner specified.

          mouse_support
               Allow use of the mouse for input and travel.

          player_selection
            SLASH'EM should pop up dialog boxes, or use prompts for charac-
            ter selection.

          popup_dialog
               SLASH'EM should pop up dialog boxes for input.

          preload_tiles
            SLASH'EM should preload tiles into memory.  For example, in the
            protected mode MSDOS version, control whether  tiles  get  pre-
            loaded  into  RAM  at the start of the game.  Doing so enhances
            performance of the tile graphics, but uses  more  memory.  (de-
            fault on).  Cannot be set with the `O' command.

          scroll_amount
            SLASH'EM should scroll the display by this number of cells when
            the hero reaches the scroll_margin.

          scroll_margin
            SLASH'EM should scroll the display when the hero or  cursor  is
            this number of cells away from the edge of the window.

          softkeyboard
               Display an onscreen keyboard.  Handhelds are most likely  to
               support this option.

          splash_screen
            SLASH'EM should display an opening splash screen when it starts
            up (default yes).

          tiled_map
               SLASH'EM should display a tiled map if it can.

          tile_file
               Specify the name of an alternative tile file to override the
               default.

          tile_height
               Specify  the preferred height of each tile in a tile capable
               port.

          tile_width
            Specify the preferred width of each tile in a tile capable port

          use_inverse
               SLASH'EM  should display inverse when the game specifies it.

          vary_msgcount
               SLASH'EM should display this number of messages at a time in
               the message window.

          windowcolors
            SLASH'EM  should  display  windows  with  the  specified  fore-
            ground/background colors if it can.

          wraptext
            SLASH'EM port should wrap long lines of text if they don't  fit
            in the visible area of the window.

          9.7.  Platform-specific Customization options

               Here  are  explanations of options that are used by specific
          platforms or ports to customize and change the port behavior.

          altkeyhandler
               Select an alternate keystroke handler dll to load (Win32 tty
            SLASH'EM  only).   The name of the handler is specified without
            the .dll extension and without any path information.  Cannot be
            set with the `O' command.

          altmeta
               (default on, AMIGA SLASH'EM only).

          BIOS
            Use BIOS calls to update the screen display quickly and to read
            the keyboard (allowing the use of arrow keys to  move)  on  ma-
            chines  with  an IBM PC compatible BIOS ROM (default off, OS/2,
            PC, and ST SLASH'EM only).

          flush
               (default off, AMIGA SLASH'EM only).

          MACgraphics
               (default on, Mac SLASH'EM only).

          page_wait
               (default on, Mac SLASH'EM only).

          rawio
            Force raw (non-cbreak) mode for faster output and more  bullet-
            proof  input  (MS-DOS sometimes treats `^P' as a printer toggle
            without it) (default off, OS/2,  PC,  and  ST  SLASH'EM  only).
            Note:   DEC  Rainbows hang if this is turned on.  Cannot be set
            with the `O' command.

          soundcard
               (default on, PC SLASH'EM only).  Cannot be set with the  `O'
               command.

          subkeyvalue
            (Win32  tty  SLASH'EM only).  May be used to alter the value of
            keystrokes that the operating system  returns  to  SLASH'EM  to
            help   compensate   for  international  keyboard  issues.   OP-
            TIONS=subkeyvalue:171/92 will return 92 to SLASH'EM, if 171 was
            originally  going to be returned.  You can use multiple subkey-
            value statements in the config file if needed.  Cannot  be  set
            with the `O' command.




          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             51



          video
               Set the video mode used (PC SLASH'EM only).  Values are `au-
            todetect', `default', or `vga'.  Setting `vga' (or `autodetect'
            with  vga  hardware  present)  will  cause  the game to display
            tiles.  Cannot be set with the `O' command.

          videocolors
               Set the color palette for PC systems using NO_TERMS (default
            4-2-6-1-5-3-15-12-10-14-9-13-11, (PC SLASH'EM only).  The order
            of  colors  is  red,  green,  brown,   blue,   magenta,   cyan,
               bright.white, bright.red, bright.green, yellow, bright.blue,
               bright.magenta, and bright.cyan.  Cannot be set with the `O'
               command.

          videoshades
            Set the intensity level of the three gray scales available (de-
            fault dark normal light, PC SLASH'EM only).  If the  game  dis-
            play  is difficult to read, try adjusting these scales; if this
            does not correct the problem, try !color.  Cannot be  set  with
            the `O' command.

          9.8.  Configuring autopickup exceptions

               There  is  an  experimental  compile  time option called AU-
          TOPICKUP_EXCEPTIONS.  If your copy of the  game  was  built  with
          that  option  defined, you can further refine the behavior of the
          autopickup option beyond what  is  available  through  the  pick-
          up_types option.

               By  placing autopickup_exception lines in your configuration
          file, you can define patterns to be  checked  when  the  game  is
          about to autopickup something.

          autopickup_exception
            Sets  an  exception  to the pickup_types option.  The autopick-
            up_exception option should be followed  by  a  string  of  1-80
            characters  to be used as a pattern to match against the singu-
            lar form of the description of an object at your location.

               You may use the following special characters in a pattern:

                 *--- matches 0 or more characters.
                 ?--- matches any single character.

               In addition, some characters are treated specially  if  they
          occur as the first character in the string pattern, specifically:

               < - always pickup an object that matches the pattern that follows.
               > - never pickup an object that matches the pattern that follows.

               Can be set with the `O' command, but the setting is not pre-
          served across saves and restores.




          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             52



               Here's a couple of examples of autopickup_exceptions:

               autopickup_exception="<*arrow"
               autopickup_exception=">*corpse"
               autopickup_exception=">* cursed*"

          The  first example above will result in autopickup of any type of
          arrow.  The second example results in the exclusion of any corpse
          from  autopickup.   The  last example results in the exclusion of
          items known to be cursed from autopickup.  A `never pickup'  rule
          takes precedence over an `always pickup' rule if both match.

          9.9.  Configuring User Sounds

               Some  platforms allow you to define sound files to be played
          when a message that matches a user-defined pattern  is  delivered
          to the message window.  At this time the Qt port and the win32tty
          and win32gui ports support the use of user sounds.

               The following config file entries are  relevant  to  mapping
          user sounds to messages:

          SOUNDDIR
               The directory that houses the sound files to be played.

          SOUND
               An  entry that maps a sound file to a user-specified message
               pattern.  Each SOUND entry is broken down into the following
               parts:

                    MESG       - message window mapping (the only one supported in 3.4).
                    pattern    - the pattern to match.
                    sound file - the sound file to play.
                    volume     - the volume to be set while playing the sound file.

               The  exact  format  for  the  pattern depends on whether the
          platform is built to use ``regular  expressions''  or  SLASH'EM's
          own  internal  pattern  matching  facility. The ``regular expres-
          sions'' matching can be much more sophisticated than the internal
          SLASH'EM  pattern  matching,  but requires 3rd party libraries on
          some platforms.  There are plenty of references  available  else-
          where  for  explaining  ``regular  expressions''.  You can verify
          which pattern matching is used by your  port  with  the  #version
          command.

               SLASH'EM's  internal  pattern matching routine uses the fol-
          lowing special characters in its pattern matching:

                 *--- matches 0 or more characters.
                 ?--- matches any single character.

               Here's an example of a sound mapping using SLASH'EM's inter-
          nal pattern matching facility:



          SLASH'EM 0.0.7                                  December 10, 2003





          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             53



                   SOUND=MESG "*chime of a cash register*" "gong.wav" 50

          specifies  that  any message with "chime of a cash register" con-
          tained in it will trigger the playing  of  "gong.wav".   You  can
          have multiple SOUND entries in your config file.

          9.10.  Configuring SLASH'EM for Play by the Blind

               SLASH'EM can be set up to use only standard ASCII characters
          for making maps of the dungeons. This makes the  MS-DOS  versions
          of  SLASH'EM  completely  accessible  to the blind who use speech
          and/or Braille access technologies.  Players will require a  good
          working  knowledge  of their screen-reader's review features, and
          will have to know how to  navigate  horizontally  and  vertically
          character  by character. They will also find the search capabili-
          ties of their screen-readers to be quite valuable. Be certain  to
          examine  this  Guidebook  before playing so you have an idea what
          the screen layout is like. You'll also need to be able to  locate
          the  PC  cursor.  It  is  always where your character is located.
          Merely searching for an @-sign will not always find your  charac-
          ter since there are other humanoids represented by the same sign.
          Your screen-reader should also have a function  which  gives  you
          the  row  and  column  of  your  review cursor and the PC cursor.
          These co-ordinates are often useful in giving  players  a  better
          sense of the overall location of items on the screen.

               While  it is not difficult for experienced users to edit the
          defaults.nh file to accomplish this, novices may find  this  task
          somewhat  daunting.   Included  in  all official distributions of
          SLASH'EM is a file  called  NHAccess.nh.   Replacing  defaults.nh
          with  this file will cause the game to run in a manner accessible
          to the blind. After you have gained some experience with the game
          and  with editing files, you may want to alter settings to better
          suit your preferences. Instructions on how to do this are includ-
          ed  in  the NHAccess.nh file itself. The most crucial settings to
          make the game accessible are:

          IBMgraphics
               Disable IBMgraphics by commenting out this option.

          menustyle:traditional
               This will assist in the interface to speech synthesizers.

          number_pad
               A lot of speech access programs use the number-pad to review
            the screen.  If this is the case, disable the number_pad option
            and use the traditional Rogue-like commands.

          Character graphics
            Comment out all character graphics sets found near  the  bottom
            of  the defaults.nh file.  Most of these replace SLASH'EM's de-
            fault representation of the dungeon using standard ASCII  char-
            acters  with  fancier  characters from extended character sets,
            and these fancier characters can annoy screen-readers.

          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             54



          10.  Scoring

               SLASH'EM  maintains  a  list of the top scores or scorers on
          your machine, depending on how it is set up.  In the latter case,
          each  account  on the machine can post only one non-winning score
          on this list.  If you score higher  than  someone  else  on  this
          list,  or better your previous score, you will be inserted in the
          proper place under your current name.  How many scores  are  kept
          can also be set up when SLASH'EM is compiled.

               Your  score  is  chiefly  based upon how much experience you
          gained, how much loot you accumulated, how deep you explored, and
          how the game ended.  If you quit the game, you escape with all of
          your gold intact.  If, however, you get killed in  the  Mazes  of
          Menace, the guild will only hear about 90% of your gold when your
          corpse is discovered (adventurers  have  been  known  to  collect
          finder's  fees).   So, consider whether you want to take one last
          hit at that monster and possibly live,  or  quit  and  stop  with
          whatever  you  have.  If you quit, you keep all your gold, but if
          you swing and live, you might find more.

               If you just want to see what the current  top  players/games
          list is, you can type slashem -s all on most versions.


          11.  Explore mode

               SLASH'EM  is an intricate and difficult game.  Novices might
          falter in fear, aware of their ignorance of the means to survive.
          Well,  fear  not.   Your  dungeon may come equipped with an ``ex-
          plore'' or ``discovery'' mode that enables you to keep  old  save
          files  and  cheat death, at the paltry cost of not getting on the
          high score list.

               There are two ways of enabling  explore  mode.   One  is  to
          start the game with the -X switch.  The other is to issue the `X'
          command while already playing the game.  The  other  benefits  of
          explore mode are left for the trepid reader to discover.

               The original hack game was  modeled  on  the  Berkeley  UNIX
          rogue  game.   Large  portions  of  this  paper  were shamelessly
          cribbed from A Guide to the Dungeons of Doom, by Michael  C.  Toy
          and  Kenneth  C.  R. C. Arnold.  Small portions were adapted from
          Further Exploration of the Dungeons of Doom, by Ken Arromdee.

               SLASH'EM is the product  of  literally  dozens  of  people's
          work.   Main events in the course of the game development are de-
          scribed below:

               Jay  Fenlason  wrote the original Hack, with help from Kenny
          Woodland, Mike Thome and Jon Payne.

               Andries Brouwer did a major re-write, transforming Hack into
          a  very  different  game, and published (at least) three versions
          (1.0.1, 1.0.2, and 1.0.3) for UNIX machines to the Usenet.

               Don G. Kneller ported Hack 1.0.3 to Microsoft C and  MS-DOS,
          producing  PC  HACK 1.01e, added support for DEC Rainbow graphics
          in version 1.03g, and went on to produce at least four more  ver-
          sions (3.0, 3.2, 3.51, and 3.6).

               R.  Black  ported  PC  HACK  3.51 to Lattice C and the Atari
          520/1040ST, producing ST Hack 1.03.

               Mike Stephenson merged these various versions back together,
          incorporating  many  of  the added features, and produced NetHack
          1.4.  He then coordinated a cast of thousands  in  enhancing  and
          debugging  NetHack 1.4 and released NetHack versions 2.2 and 2.3.

               Later, Mike coordinated a major rewrite of the game, heading
          a team which included Ken Arromdee, Jean-Christophe Collet, Steve
          Creps, Eric Hendrickson, Izchak Miller, John Rupley, Mike Threep-
          oint, and Janet Walz, to produce NetHack 3.0c.

               NetHack  3.0  was  ported  to the Atari by Eric R. Smith, to
          OS/2 by Timo Hakulinen, and to VMS by David Gentzel.   The  three
          of them and Kevin Darcy later joined the main development team to
          produce subsequent revisions of 3.0.

               Olaf Seibert ported NetHack 2.3 and 3.0 to the Amiga.   Norm
          Meluch,  Stephen  Spackman  and Pierre Martineau designed overlay
          code for PC NetHack 3.0.  Johnny Lee ported NetHack  3.0  to  the
          Macintosh.   Along with various other Dungeoneers, they continued
          to enhance the PC, Macintosh, and Amiga ports through  the  later
          revisions of 3.0.

               A  scant  one month before the next major version release of
          NetHack, two adventurous souls undertook their  own  modification
          to  the  sacred NetHack formula. Tom Proudfoot and Yuval released
          Nethack++,  which was rapidly renamed Nethack--,   contained  new
          monsters,  items and other miscellaneous modifications.

               Headed  by  Mike Stephenson and coordinated by Izchak Miller
          and Janet Walz, the development team which now included  Ken  Ar-
          romdee,  David  Cohrs,  Jean-Christophe Collet, Kevin Darcy, Matt
          Day, Timo Hakulinen, Steve Linhart, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin,  Eric
          Raymond,  and  Eric  Smith  undertook  a radical revision of 3.0.
          They re-structured the game's design, and re-wrote major parts of
          the  code.   They added multiple dungeons, a new display, special
          individual character quests, a new endgame  and  many  other  new
          features, and produced NetHack 3.1.

               Ken  Lorber,  Gregg  Wonderly and Greg Olson, with help from
          Richard Addison, Mike Passaretti,  and  Olaf  Seibert,  developed
          NetHack 3.1 for the Amiga.

               Norm  Meluch and Kevin Smolkowski, with help from Carl Sche-
          lin, Stephen Spackman, Steve VanDevender, and Paul Winner, ported
          NetHack 3.1 to the PC.

               Jon W{tte and Hao-yang Wang, with help from Ross Brown, Mike
          Engber, David Hairston, Michael Hamel, Jonathan  Handler,  Johnny
          Lee,  Tim  Lennan, Rob Menke, and Andy Swanson, developed NetHack
          3.1 for the Macintosh, porting it for MPW.  Building on their de-
          velopment, Barton House added a Think C port.

               Timo Hakulinen ported NetHack 3.1 to OS/2.  Eric Smith port-
          ed NetHack 3.1 to the Atari.  Pat Rankin, with help  from  Joshua
          Delahunty,  was  responsible  for the VMS version of NetHack 3.1.
          Michael Allison ported NetHack 3.1 to Windows NT.

               Dean Luick, with help from David  Cohrs,  developed  NetHack
          3.1  for  X11.   Warwick Allison wrote a tiled version of NetHack
          for the Atari; he later contributed the tiles to the DevTeam  and
          tile support was then added to other platforms.

               Time passed,  and Nethack-- was ported to 3.11 by Chris.

               Stephen  White  then  released his own modification known as
          Nethack Plus,  which  contained  new  character  classes.   Unbe-
          knownst  to  the  world at large,  Tom Proudfoot took this source
          and combined it with his Nethack--.  Stephen White went on to add
          weapon  skills,   which  were eventually integrated into the next
          version of Nethack,  and other features.

               In February 1996,  Tom Proudfoot released SLASH V1.  Includ-
          ing  part  of Stephen White's Nethack Plus and his own Nethack--,
          leaving unmentioned his own slew of further modifications,   this
          is perhaps the best known of the Nethack modifications.  Six ver-
          sions of this,  ending with SLASH V6,  are known to exist.

               The 3.2 development team, comprised of Michael Allison,  Ken
          Arromdee,  David  Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Steve Creps, Kevin Darcy,
          Timo Hakulinen, Steve  Linhart,  Dean  Luick,  Pat  Rankin,  Eric
          Smith,  Mike  Stephenson,  Janet  Walz, and Paul Winner, released
          version 3.2 in April of 1996.

               Version 3.2 marked the tenth anniversary of the formation of
          the  development team.  In a testament to their dedication to the
          game, all thirteen members of the original development  team  re-
          mained  on the team at the start of work on that release.  During
          the interval between the release of 3.1.3 and  3.2,  one  of  the
          founding  members of the development team, Dr. Izchak Miller, was
          diagnosed with cancer and passed away.  That release of the  game
          was dedicated to him by the development and porting teams.

               Larry Stewart-Zerba set along a different track - to enhance
          the spellcasting abilities of the Wizard.   Thus, in April  1996,
          he  released  version  0.1 of the Wizard Patch.  By July,  he was
          joined by Warwick Allison and version 0.4 of the Wizard Patch was
          released.  The final update came in April 1997,  with the release
          of Wizard Patch 1.0.

               Warwick Allison also ported NetHack to use the Qt interface.

               SLASH  V6  was picked up by Enrico Horn, who managed to syn-
          chronize it with the 3.2 source.  The new  SLASH  4.1.2  was  re-
          leased  as  far back as November 1996 went through at least 4 ed-
          itlevels (E5, E6, E7) with  the  latest  version  being  4.1.2E8,
          synchronized with Nethack 3.2.2 and the Blackmarket option avail-
          able,  released in June 1997.

               Nathan La began the arduous task of drawing  tiles  for  the
          SLASH monsters.

               Kentaro Shirakata ported SLASH 4.1.2E8 to Unix.

               Lief Clennon ported SLASH 4.1.2E8 to OS/2 EMX.

               Romain Dolbeau ported SLASH 4.1.2E8 to Macintosh.

               Warren  Cheung combined SLASH 4.1.2 and Wizard Patch to cre-
          ate SLASH'EM 0.1 in November 1997.  Several  revisions  including
          new  spells  and  other  additions  led  eventually  to  SLASH'EM
          0.0.5E7F1. Steven Uy generously made additional modifications.

               Dirk Schoenberger continued updating the SLASH/SLASH'EM mon-
          ster tiles.  He also ported SLASH'EM to Linux.

               Lief Clennon ported SLASH'EM to OS/2 EMX.

               Kevin  Hugo  ported  SLASH'EM  to  Macintosh,  and also con-
          tributed additional changes and improvements.

               Robin Johnson finished the arduous task of drawing tiles for
          the  SLASH'EM monsters.  He also contributed many more new tiles.

               Kevin later joined the DevTeam and incorporated the best  of
          these ideas in NetHack 3.3.

               JNetHack  (the  Japanese version of NetHack) has been around
          since at least 1994, developed by Issei Numata  and  others.  The
          GTK  interface was written for this variant and released in 1999.

               Mitsuhiro Itakura headed a team which began the  process  of
          redrawing the NetHack tiles in 8-bit color at 32x32 pixels.

               The final update to 3.2 was the bug fix release 3.2.3, which
          was released simultaneously with 3.3.0 in December 1999  just  in
          time for the Year 2000.

               The 3.3 development team, consisting of Michael Allison, Ken
          Arromdee, David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Steve Creps,  Kevin  Darcy,
          Timo  Hakulinen,  Kevin  Hugo,  Steve  Linhart,  Ken Lorber, Dean
          Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Smith, Mike Stephenson, Janet  Walz,  and
          Paul  Winner, released 3.3.0 in December 1999 and 3.3.1 in August
          of 2000.

               Version 3.3 offered many firsts. It was the first version to
          separate  race and profession. The Elf class was removed in pref-
          erence to an elf race, and the races of dwarves, gnomes, and orcs
          made  their  first  appearance in the game alongside the familiar
          human race.  Monk and Ranger roles joined Archeologists,  Barbar-
          ians,   Cavemen,  Healers,  Knights,  Priests,  Rogues,  Samurai,
          Tourists, Valkyries and of course,  Wizards.   It  was  also  the
          first  version  to  allow  you to ride a steed, and was the first
          version to have a publicly available  web-site  listing  all  the
          bugs  that  had been discovered.  Despite that constantly growing
          bug list, 3.3 proved stable enough to last for more than  a  year
          and a half.

               The  3.4 development team initially consisted of Michael Al-
          lison, Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Kevin Hugo,  Ken
          Lorber,  Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and
          Paul Winner, with  Warwick Allison joining just  before  the  re-
          lease of NetHack 3.4.0 in March 2002.

               As  with version 3.3, various people contributed to the game
          as a whole as well as supporting ports on the different platforms
          that NetHack runs on:

               Pat Rankin maintained 3.4 for VMS.

               Michael  Allison maintained NetHack 3.4 for the MS-DOS plat-
          form.  Paul Winner and Yitzhak Sapir provided encouragement.

               Dean Luick, Mark Modrall, and Kevin Hugo maintained and  en-
          hanced the Macintosh port of 3.4.

               Michael  Allison,  David  Cohrs, Alex Kompel, Dion Nicolaas,
          and Yitzhak Sapir maintained and enhanced 3.4 for  the  Microsoft
          Windows platform.  Alex Kompel contributed a new graphical inter-
          face for the Windows port.  Alex Kompel also contributed  a  Win-
          dows  CE  port  for  3.4.1.   Ron Van Iwaarden maintained 3.4 for
          OS/2.

               Janne Salmijarvi and Teemu Suikki  maintained  and  enhanced
          the  Amiga  port of 3.4 after Janne Salmijarvi resurrected it for
          3.3.1.

               Christian ``Marvin'' Bressler maintained 3.4 for  the  Atari
          after he resurrected it for 3.3.1.

               There  is  a  NetHack  web  site maintained by Ken Lorber at
          http://www.nethack.org/.

          SLASH'EM Guidebook                                             59



               Warren Cheung combined SLASH'EM 0.0.5E7F1 and NetHack 3.3 to
          create  SLASH'EM  0.0.6 and continues to maintain the DOS and Mi-
          crosoft Windows ports.

               J. Ali Harlow incorporated the GTK interface  and  Mitsuhiro
          Itakura's  32x32  tileset  into  SLASH'EM 0.0.6 and maintains the
          UNIX port of SLASH'EM.  Peter Makholm maintains the Debian  pack-
          age.

               Paul Hurtley maintains the MAC port of SLASH'EM.

               From  time  to  time,  some depraved individual out there in
          netland sends a particularly intriguing modification to help  out
          with  the  game.   The Gods of the Dungeon sometimes make note of
          the names of the worst of these miscreants in this, the  list  of
